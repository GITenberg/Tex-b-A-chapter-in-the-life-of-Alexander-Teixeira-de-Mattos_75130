<p>I dedicate to you this slight tribute to the memory of
our friend. You were the luckier, in knowing him the
longer. I shall be more than content if you find, in
reading this book, as I found in reading his letters
again, that he has returned to us even for a moment and
that a whim of his language or an echo of his laughter
has recreated the triple alliance which he founded.</p>

<p>I trust also you may be long without finding out the

<h1>Alexander Teixeira de Mattos</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

</div>

<p>“<i>A great translator</i>,” one friend wrote of
Teixeira, “<i>is far more rare than a great
author.</i>”</p>

<p>Judged by the quality and volume of his
work, by the range of foreign languages from
which he translated and by the perfection
of the English in which he rendered them,
Teixeira was incontestably the greatest translator
of his time. Throughout Great Britain
and the United States his name has long been
held in honour by all who have watched,
cheering, as the literature of France and
Belgium, of Germany and the Netherlands,
of Denmark and Norway strode along the
broad viaduct which his labours had, in
great part, established.</p>

<p>Of the man, apart from his name, little has
been made public. His love of laughing at
himself might prompt him to say: “When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
you write my <i>Life and Letters</i> ...”; but
his modesty and his humour would have been
perturbed in equal measure by the vision of
a solemn biography and a low-voiced press.
“I was a little bit underpraised before,” he
once confessed; “I’m being a little bit overpraised
now.” Since the best of himself
went impartially into all that he wrote, his
conscience could never be haunted by the
recollection of shoddy workmanship, even in
the days before he had a reputation to jeopardize;
nor, when he had won recognition,
could his head be turned by the announcement
that he had created a masterpiece. If he
enjoyed the consciousness of having filled
the English treasury with the literary spoils
of six countries, he dissembled his enjoyment.
In so far as he wished to be remembered at all,
it was not as a man of letters, but as a friend,
a connoisseur of life, a man of sympathy unaging
and zest unstaled, a lover of simple
jests, a laughing philosopher. Of their charity,
he wished those who loved him to have
masses said for the repose of his soul; he
would have been tortured by the thought that,
in life or death, he had brought unhappiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
to any one or that, dead or living, he had
prompted any one to discuss him with pomposity.
“Are you not being a little solemn?”
was a question that alternated with the advice:
“Cultivate a pococurantist attitude to life.”</p>

<p>“If there had been no <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,”
said another friend, “it would have
been necessary for Tex to create her.”</p>

<p>Those who knew the translator of Fabre
and Ewald, of Maeterlinck and Couperus
only by his awe-inspiring name must detect in
this a hint that Alexander Teixeira de Mattos
had a lighter side to his nature; the suspicion
can best be established or laid by the evidence
of his own letters.</p>

<p>The present volume is an attempt to sketch
the man in outline for those readers who have
recognized his talent in scholarship without
guessing his genius for friendship. “The
apostles are not all dead,” he wrote, in criticism
of the legends that were growing up
around the men of the nineties; “many of
them are your living contemporaries; you
could, if you like, receive at first hand their
memories of their dead fellows.” ... It is
the purpose of this sketch to present one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
‘apostle’ as he revealed himself to one of his
disciples. A biography and bibliography
will be found in the appropriate works of reference.
Only a single chapter has been attempted
here; of those who knew him during
the nineties, which he loved so well and of
which he preserved the tradition so faithfully,
perhaps one will write that earlier chapter
and describe Teixeira in the position which
he took up on their outskirts. And one better
qualified than the present writer should paint
this sphinx of the bridge-table, with his perversity
of declaration and his brilliance of
play. “You have made your contract,” admitted
a friend who was partnering him for
the first time; “but ... but ... but <i>why</i>
that declaration?” “I wanted to see your expression,”
answered Teixeira with the complacency
of a man who did not greatly mind
whether he won or lost, but abominated a dull
game. Those who knew him all his life may
feel, with the writer, that the last half-dozen
years constitute, naturally and dramatically, a
chapter by themselves. They are the period
of his literary recognition and, unhappily, of
his physical decline; of his emergence from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
seclusion; of his first public services and his
last private friendships.</p>

<p>By 1914 Teixeira stood in the forefront of
English translators; and, through his labours,
translation had won a place in the forefront
of English literature. Almost simultaneously
with the outbreak of war, he was
attacked by the heart-affection that ultimately
killed him; and the record of this period is
the record of an invalid. Ill-health notwithstanding,
he offered his energy and ability to
the country of his adoption; and, in an emergency
war-department largely staffed by men
of letters, the most retiring of them all became
enmeshed in the machinery of government.
From his marriage until the war,
Teixeira had lived an almost monastic life,
only relaxing his rule of solitary work in
favour of the bridge-table. Once set in the
midst of appreciative friends, this sham recluse
found himself entertaining and being
entertained, joining new clubs, indulging his
old inscrutable sociability and almost overcoming
his former shyness.</p>

<p>For three-and-a-half out of these last seven
years, one of Teixeira’s colleagues worked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
with him almost daily at the same table in the
same room of the same department. The rare
separations due to leave or illness were countered
by an almost daily correspondence, conducted
in the spirit of an intimate and elaborate
game; and, when the work of the department
ended, the letters—sometimes interrupted
by a diary or suspended for a meeting—kept
the intimacy unbroken.</p>

<p>So written, they are as personal, as discursive
and—to a stranger—as full of allusion as
the long-sustained conversation of two friends.
It is to be hoped that, in their present form,
they are at least not obscure; of these, and of
all, letters it must not be forgotten that the
writer was not counting his words for a telegram
nor selecting his subjects for later publication.</p>

<p>From his half of the correspondence—in
a life untouched by drama—Teixeira’s personality
may be left to reconstruct itself.
Not every side of his character is revealed,
for an interchange conducted primarily as a
game afforded him few opportunities of exhibiting
his serene philosophy and meditative
bent. The absence of all calculation from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
his mind—a part of his refusal to grow up—may,
for want of counter-availing ballast, be
interpreted as flippancy. And, as the man
was greater than the word he wrote and the
word he translated, his letters have to be supplied
by imagination with some of the radiance
which he shed over preposterous story
and trivial jest. Charm, which is so hard
to analyse in the living, is yet harder to
recapture from the dead; but, if the record
of a single friendship can suggest loyalty,
courage, generosity and tenderness, if a
whimsical turn of phrase can indicate
humour, patience and an infinite capacity for
providing and receiving enjoyment, Teixeira’s
letters will preserve, for those who did not
know him, the fragrance of spirit recognized
and remembered by all who did.</p>

</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1914 a censorship department
was improvised in the office of the
National Service League. A press-gang of
two, working the clubs of London and the
colleges of Oxford, established the nucleus of
a staff; and the first recruits were given, as
their earliest duty, the task of bringing in
more recruits. As the department had been
formed to examine the commercial correspondence
of neutrals and enemies, the first
qualification of a candidate was a knowledge
of languages; and, in the preliminary search
for recruits, Alfred Sutro convinced the friend
who had succeeded him in translating Maeterlinck
that a man who was equally at home
in English, French, German, Flemish, Dutch
and Danish, with a smattering of ecclesiastical
Latin, was too valuable to be spared. Teixeira
joined the growing brotherhood of lawyers,
dons and business men in Palace Street,
Westminster, advising on intercepted letters
and cables, curtailing the activities of traders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
in contraband, assimilating the procedure of
a government department and being paid
stealthily each week, like a member of some
criminal association, with a furtive bundle of
notes.</p>

<p>It was his first experience of the public service,
almost his only taste of responsibility;
and it marked the end of the cloistered life.
Though he brought to his new work a varied
knowledge of affairs, Teixeira had participated
but little in them since his marriage in
1900. The friends of his youth, when he was
living in the Temple,—John Gray and Ernest
Dowson, William Wilde (whose widow he
married) and William Campbell,—such
acquaintances as Oscar Wilde and Max
Beerbohm, Robert Ross and Bernard Shaw,
Leonard Smithers and Frank Harris, were
for the most part scattered or dead; and,
though he kept touch with J. T. Grein, Edgar
Jepson, Alfred Sutro and a few more, he
seemed at this time, after Campbell’s death,
to lack opportunity and inclination for making
new friends.</p>

<p>His gregarious years, and the varied experience
which they brought, belonged to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
earlier period. Coming from Amsterdam to
London in 1874 at the age of nine, the son
of a Dutch father and an English mother,
Teixeira<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> placed himself under instruction
with Monsignor Capel and was received into
the Holy Roman Catholic Church. In
blood, faith and nationality, the Dutch Protestant
of Portuguese-Jewish extraction had
thus passed through many vicissitudes before
he married an Irish wife, became a British
citizen and died a Catholic. Traces of the
Jew survived in his appearance; of the Dutchman
in his speech; and his intellectual and
racial mixed ancestry was betrayed by a cosmopolitan
outlook. Ignorant of many prejudices
that are the native Briton’s birthright,
he remained ever aloof from the passions of
British thought and speech. If he respected,
at least he could not share the conventional
enthusiasms nor associate himself with the conventional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
judgements of his new countrymen.
He wrote of his neighbours among whom he
had lived for more than forty years, with an
unaffected sense of remoteness, as “the English”;
after his naturalization, he was fond of
talking, tongue in cheek, about what “we English”
thought and did; but, in the last analysis,
he embodied too many various strains to
favour any single nationality.</p>

<p>After being educated at the Kensington
Catholic Public School and at Beaumont,
Teixeira worked for some time in the City
and was rescued for literature by J. T. Grein,
who made him secretary of the Independent
Theatre. By his work as a translator and as
the London correspondent of a Dutch paper,
he lived precariously until his renderings of
Maeterlinck, whose official translator he became
with <i>The Double Garden</i>, called public
attention to a new quality of scholarship.
Though he flirted with journalism, as editor
of <i>Dramatic Opinions</i> and of <i>The Candid
Friend</i>, and with publishing, in connection
with Leonard Smithers, translation was the
business of his life until he entered government
service. He is best known for his version<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of Fabre’s natural history, which he lived
to complete and which he himself regarded
as his greatest achievement, for the later
plays and essays of Maeterlinck, for the novels
and stories of Ewald and for the novels
of Couperus. These, however, formed only
a part of his output; and his bibliography includes
the names of Zola, Châteaubriand, de
Tocqueville, President Kruger, Maurice Leblanc,
Madame Leblanc, Streuvels and many
more. One work alone ran to more than a
million words; and he married on a commission
to translate what he called “the longest
book in any language”.</p>

<p>The improvised censorship was not long
suffered to function unmolested. The home
secretary, learning that his majesty’s mails
were being opened without due authority,
warned the unorthodox censors that they were
incurring a heavy fine for each offence and
advised them to regularize their position.
Simultaneously, the Customs were thrown into
difficulty and confusion,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by the proclamation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of the king in council, forbidding all
trade with the enemy: in the absence of records,
investigation and an intelligence department,
it was impossible to say whether
goods cleared from London would ultimately
reach enemy destination; and the censors who
were watching the cable and wireless operations
of Dutch and Scandinavian importers
seemed the natural advisers to approach. At
this point the embryonic department, which
had risen from the ashes of the National
Service League, joined with a licensing delegation
from the Customs to form the War
Trade Department and Trade Clearing
House.</p>

<p>Drifting about Westminster from Palace
Street to Central Buildings, from Central
Buildings to Broadway House and from
Broadway House to Lake Buildings, St.
James’ Park, the War Trade Intelligence Department,
as it came to be called, was made
the advisory body to the Blockade Department
of the Foreign Office, with Lord Robert
Cecil as its parliamentary chief, Sir Henry
Penson, of Worcester College, as its chairman,
and H. W. C. Davis, of Balliol, as its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
deputy-chairman. Teixeira, as the head of
the Intelligence Section, controlled the supply
of advice on the export of “prohibited commodities”
to neutral countries; as a member
of the Advisory Board, he came later to share
in responsibility for the department as a
whole. Among his colleagues, not already
named, were “Freddie” Browning, the first
organizer of the department, O. R. A. Simpkin,
now Public Trustee, H. B. Betterton,
now a member of parliament, Michael Sadleir,
the novelist, R. S. Rait, the Scottish Historiographer-Royal,
John Palmer, the dramatic
critic, and G. L. Bickersteth, the translator of
Carducci.</p>

<p>When the department came to an end,
Teixeira resumed his interrupted task of translation,
which had, indeed, never been wholly
abandoned; his daily programme during the
war was to work at home from 5.0 a.m. till
8.0 a.m. and in his department from 10.0 a.m.
till 6.0 p.m. or 7.0 p.m., then to play
bridge for an hour at the Cleveland Club, returning
home in time for a light dinner and
an early bed.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>Leisure, when at last it came to him, was
not to be long enjoyed: early in 1920, a further
break in health compelled him to undertake
a rest-cure, first at Crowborough and then
in the Isle of Wight. He returned to Chelsea
in the spring of 1921 and spent the summer
and autumn working in London or staying
with friends in the country, to all appearances
better than he had been for some years,
though in play and work alike he had now to
walk circumspectly. Towards the end of the
year he went to Cornwall for the winter and
collapsed from <i>angina pectoris</i> on 5 December
1921.</p>

<p>In a life of nearly fifty-seven years Teixeira
escaped almost everything that could be
considered spectacular. Happy in the devotion
of his wife and the love of his friends,
unshaken in the faith which he had embraced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and untroubled by the misgivings and melancholy
that assail a temperament less serene,
he faced the world with a manner of gentle
understanding and a philosophy of almost universal
toleration. His only child—a boy—died
within a few hours of birth; Teixeira
was troubled for years by ill-health; he was
never rich and seldom even assured of a comfortable
income. Nevertheless his temper or
faith gave him power to extract more amusement
from his sufferings than most men derive
from the plentitude of health and fortune.
Of a malady new even to his experience
he writes: “Is death imminent? Why
do I always have the rarer disorders?” He
loved life to the end—the world was always
“God’s dear world” to him—; to the end, he,
who had known so many of the world’s waifs,
continued forbearing to all but the censorious.
“I was taught very early in life,” he writes,
“to make every allowance for men of any
genius, whereas you look for a public-school
attitude towards all and sundry.... You
see, if one cared to take the pains, one could
make you detest pretty well everybody you
know and like. For everybody has a mean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
petty, shabby, cowardly side to him; and one
had only to tell you of what the man in question
chooses to keep concealed.” ...</p>

<p>“Life,” said Samuel Butler, “is like playing
a violin solo in public and learning the instrument
as one goes on.” Those who met Teixeira
only in his later years must have felt that
he was born a master of his instrument; it
is not to be imagined that there could ever
have been a time when he was ignorant of
the grace, the urbanity, the consideration and
the gusto that mark off the artist in life from
his fellows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2>

</div>

<p>Though his letters contain scattered references
to the principles which he followed in
translation, Teixeira could never be persuaded
to publish his complete and considered
theory. His excuse was that he had
never been able to write more than eight hundred
words of original matter, a disability
that once threatened him with disaster when
he was invited to lecture on the science and
art of bridge to the members of a club formed
for mutual improvement and the pursuit of
learning. After being entertained at a fortifying
banquet, Teixeira delivered his eight-hundred
words. As, at the end of the two
and three-quarter minutes which his reading
occupied, the audience seemed ready and
even anxious for more, he read his address
a second time. Later, he began in the middle;
later still, he ran disgracefully from the
hall.</p>

<p>The method which he followed in translation
has, therefore, to be reconstructed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the internal evidence of his books and from
personal experience in collaboration.</p>

<p>“I shall not,” wrote Matthew Arnold in
criticizing Newman, “in the least concern
myself with theories of translation as such.
But I advise the translator not to try ‘to rear
on the basis of the <i>Iliad</i>, a poem that shall
affect our countrymen as the original may be
conceived to have affected its natural hearers’;
and for this simple reason, that we cannot
possibly tell <i>how</i> the <i>Iliad</i> ‘affected its natural
hearers.’”</p>

<p>The first quality that distinguishes Teixeira
from most of the translators whose work and
methods of work have swelled the controversial
literature of translation is that he
confined himself to modern authors. Unacquainted
with Greek and little versed in
Latin, he was never faced with the difficulty
of having to imagine how an original work
affected its natural hearers. Maeterlinck
and Couperus were his personal friends;
Fabre and Ewald, who predeceased him,
were older contemporaries; it is only with de
Tocqueville and Châteaubriand that he had
to gauge the intellectual atmosphere of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
earlier generation. In judging whether his
English rendering left on the minds of
English readers the same impression as the
original had left on its “natural hearers”, he
had a court of appeal always available; and,
while the English reader is “lulled into the
illusion that he is reading an original work”,
the foreign author can testify to the fidelity
with which his text has been followed and his
spirit reproduced. “What a magnificent
translation <i>The Tour</i> is!” Couperus writes;
“what a most charming little book it has
become! I am in raptures over it and have
read it and reread it all day and have had
tears in my eyes and have laughed over it.
You may think it silly of me to say all this;
but it has become an exquisitely beautiful
work in its English form. My warmest
congratulations!”</p>

<p>To achieve this illusion, Teixeira began
his literary life with the most essential quality
of a translator: an equal knowledge of the
language that was to be translated and of the
language into which he was translating it.
English and Dutch came to him by inheritance;
French and Flemish, German and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Danish he added by study; and throughout
his working life he was incessantly sharpening,
polishing and adding to his tools.
Limitless reading refreshed a vast vocabulary;
meticulous accuracy refined his meanings
and justified his usages. His dictionaries
were annotated freely; and the margins
of his manuscripts were filled with challenges
and suggestions for his friends to consider,
until his own exacting fastidiousness had at
last been satisfied. Apart from professional
lexicographers, it would have been difficult
to find a man with more words in current use;
it would have been almost impossible to find
one who employed them with nicer precision.
Learning sat too lightly on his shoulders to
make him vain of it, but no one could hear or
correspond with him without realizing the
presence of a purist; he seldom quoted, mistrusting
his memory, confessed himself an
amateur in colloquial dialogue and refused
with equal obstinacy to venture on English
metaphors and English field-sports. “I do
not know the difference between a niblick
and a foursome,” he would protest. “When
you say that your withers are unwrung, I do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
not know whether you are boasting or complaining.
What are your withers? Have
you any, to begin with? Do you ‘wring’
them or ‘ring’ them? And why can’t you
leave them alone?”</p>

<p>Not content with mastering five foreign
languages, Teixeira created a new literary
English for every new kind of book that he
translated. His versions of Maeterlinck’s
<i>Blue Bird</i>, Couperus’ <i>Old People and The
Things That Pass</i>, Fabre’s <i>Hunting Wasps</i>
and Ewald’s <i>My Little Boy</i> have nothing in
common but their exquisite sympathy and
scholarship; four different men might have
produced them if four men could be found
with the same taste, knowledge and diligence.
Fabre’s ingenuous air of perpetual discovery
demanded the style of a grave, grown-up
child; Maeterlinck’s mystical essays invited
a hint of preciosity and aloofness, to suggest
that omniscience was expounding infinity
through symbols older than time; and the
atmospheric sixth-sense of Couperus had to
be communicated by a sensitiveness of language
that could create pictures and conjure
up intangible clouds of discontent, guilty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
terror, suppressed antagonism or universal
boredom. In reading the original, Teixeira
seemed to steep himself in the personality of
his author until he could pass, like a repertory
actor, from one mood and expression to
another; his own mannerisms are confined to
a few easily defended peculiarities of spelling
and punctuation.</p>

<p>For a man who must surely have divined
that his calibre was unique, Teixeira was
engagingly free from touchiness. In translating
a book, as in organizing a department,
he was magnificently grateful for the word
that had eluded him and for the criticism
which he had not foreseen. A purist in
language and a precisian in everything, he
realized that a living style is throttled by too
great obedience to rules; but he was afraid,
even in dialogue, of unchaining a wind of
colloquialism which he might be unable to
control; and, in constructing the deliberately
artificial speech of his Maeterlinck translations,
he recognized that he lacked his
readers’ age-old familiarity with the English
of the Bible. Though his passion for consistency
led him to say: “My name ought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
have been Procrus-Tex,” he stretched out
both hands for an authority that would justify
him in broadening his rule. “I have
always spelt judgment without an e in the
middle,” he declared in 1915, when, with the
gravity that characterized his more trivial
decisions, he had abandoned violet ink, because
it seemed frivolous in war-time, and the
long s (ſ), because it bore a Teutonic aspect.
“I am too old to change now; and you know
my rule, All or None.” Four years later he
announced: “In future I shall spell ‘judgement’
with an e in the middle. The New
English Dictionary favours it; you assure me
that it is so spelt in your English prayer-book;
and Germany has signed the peace
terms.”</p>

<p>No comparison with other translators can
be attempted until another arise with Teixeira’s
range of languages and his volume of
achievement. He himself could never say,
within a dozen, how many books he had
translated; but in them all he created such an
illusion of originality that they are not suspected
of being translations until his name is
seen. In a wider view, he undermined the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
pretensions of those who boasted that they
could never read translations; and, if no one
is likely to be found with all his gifts, he at
least prepared the way for a new school of
translators. It may be hoped that, after the
battles which he fought, important foreign
authors will not again be sacrificed to illiterate
hacks at five-shillings a thousand words:
it may even be expected that competent
scholars will no longer disdain the task of
translating contemporary works. All literary
predictions are rash; but there seems
little risk in prophesying that Teixeira’s renderings
of Fabre, Couperus and Maeterlinck
will be read as long as the originals.</p>

<p>The tangible fruits of his astonishing
industry are only a part of his achievement:
it is to him, in company with Constance
Garnett, William Archer, Aylmer Maude
and the other undaunted pioneers, that English
readers owe their escape from the self-satisfied
insularity with which they had protected
themselves against continental literature.
When publishers have been convinced
that translations need not be unprofitable
and when a conservative public has discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
that they need not be unreadable, a
future generation may be privileged to have
prompt access to every noteworthy book in
whatsoever language it has been written,
without waiting as the present generation has
had to wait for an English rendering of
Tolstoi, Turgenieff, Dostoieffski and Tchehov.</p>

<p>In conversation Teixeira took little pleasure
in discussing himself; in correspondence
he could not help giving himself away. The
reader will deduce, from his slow surrender
of intimacy, the shyness that ever conflicted
with his sociability; the absence of all allusions
to his literary work, save when he
fancied that a second opinion might help
him, is evidence of a personal modesty that
amounted almost to unconsciousness of his
position in letters. Diffidence and sociability,
first conflicting, then joining forces,
led him in his departmental work to discuss
every problem with a friend; and in all personal
relationships, he needed an hourly confidant
because everything in life was an
adventure to be shared and might be worked
in later to the saga with which he strove to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
make himself ridiculous for the diversion of
his company. “Thus,” he writes of a childish
freak, “do the elderly amuse themselves for
the further amusement of a limited circle.”
Weighty commissions were assembled, daring
expeditions set out under his leadership to
choose a dressing-gown for country-house
wear; the grey tall-hat with which he surprised
one private view of the Royal Academy
was no less of a surprise to him and even
more of an abiding pleasure. For a year or
two afterwards he would telephone on the
first of May: “If you will wear your goodish
white topper to-day, I will wear mine”;
and once, when these conspicuous headpieces
were in evidence, he led the way to Covent
Garden Market, with the words: “It is not
every day that the women of the market see
two men in such hats, such coats and such
spats, standing before a fruit-stall with their
canes crooked over their arms and their
yellow gloves protruding from their pockets,
consuming the first green figs of the year in
the year’s first sunshine.”</p>

<p>In conversation he once boasted that he was
never bored; and, though every man and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
woman at the table volunteered the names of
at least six people who would bore him to
extinction, the boast was justified in that,
however irksome one moment might be, it
could always be invested afterwards with the
glamour of an eccentric adventure. Somewhere,
among his immediate ascendants, there
must have been a not too remote ancestor of
Peter Pan. On his fifty-sixth birthday, Teixeira
was having a party arranged for him,
with a cake and fifty-six tiny candles; for days
beforehand he had been asking for presents
of any kind, to impress the other visitors in
his hotel; and, if he knew one joy greater
than receiving presents, it was finding an
excuse to give them.</p>

<p>With the heart of a child in all things, he
had the child’s quality of being frightened by
small pains and undaunted by great; a cut
finger was an occasion for panic, but the
threat of blindness found him indomitable.
Herein he was supported throughout life by
the faith which he had acquired in boyhood
and which he preserved until his death. “I
save my temper,” he once wrote, “by not discussing
religion except with Catholics or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
politics except with liberals. There’s room
for discussion in the <i>nuances</i>; there’s too much
room for it with those who call my black
white.” ... While it was generally known
among his friends that he was a devout Catholic,
only a few were allowed to see how much
reliance he placed in religion; and he would
grow impatient with what he considered a
morbid protestant passion for worrying at
something that for him had been immutably
settled.</p>

<p>In political debates he would only join at
the prompting of extreme sympathy or extreme
exasperation. His native feeling for
the Boers in the Transvaal was little shared
in England during the South African war;
and his loathing for English misrule in Ireland
was too strong to be ventilated acceptably
among the people whom he met most commonly
in London. His connection with the
Legitimist cause came to an end with the outbreak
of war: though he had hitherto delighted
in penetrating between the sentries at
St. James’ Palace and placarding the wall
with an appeal to all loyal subjects of the
rightful king, he was unable to continue his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
allegiance when Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria
became an enemy alien.</p>

<p>Legitimacy and Catholicism, apart from
other claims on his regard, gratified a love
for ceremonial and tradition that would have
been more incongruous in a liberal if Teixeira’s
whole equipment of beliefs, practices
and preferences had not been a collection
of incongruities. Though he detested militarism,
he could never understand why the
English civilians omitted to uncover to the
colours; hating pomposity, he enjoyed the
grand manner in address and, on being
greeted by a peer as “my dear sir,” replied
“my dear lord” in a formula beloved by Disraeli.
As a relief to an accuracy of expression
which he himself called Procrustean
and pernickety, he would transform any word
that he thought would look or sound more
engaging for a little mutilation. It was a
bad day for the English of his letters when he
read Heine and entered into competition for
the most torturing play upon words; his
case became hopeless when he was introduced
to a couple of friends who could pun with
him in four or five languages. It was this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
bent of mind that may justify the description
of him<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as the son of Edward Lear and the
grandson of Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>Underlying the whimsical humour of his
letters and peeping through the mock solemnity
of his speech was a young child’s concern
for the welfare of his friends: himself never
growing up, he never outgrew his generous
delight in any success that came to them; their
ill-health and sorrow were harder to bear
than his own; and he shewed a child’s impulsive
generosity in offering all he had in comfort.
Sympathy, help, experience and advice
were at hand for whosoever would take them:
he had too long lived precariously to forget
the tragedy of those who failed and failed
again; he knew life too well to grow impatient
with those who failed through no one’s fault
but their own.</p>

<p>Love of life, enduring to the end, knowledge
of life, increasing every day, combined
to join this heart of a child to the experience
of an old man. As a connoisseur of food and
wine, as of style and manner, he belonged to
a generation that ranked life as the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
of the fine arts. To lunch with him was to
receive a liberal education in gastronomy,
though his course of personal instruction
sometimes broke down for lack of material:
from time to time he would announce with
jubilation that he had discovered some rare
vintage in some unknown restaurant; a party
would be organized to sample it, only to be
informed that the last bottle had been consumed
by Mr. Teixeira the day before.</p>

<p>As an explorer, he remained, to his last
hour, at the age when a boy lingers rapturously
before one shop after another, enjoying
all impartially, sharing his enjoyment with
every passer-by, confident that life is an unending
vista of glittering shop-windows and
that the day must somehow be long enough
for him to take them all in.</p>

</div>

<p>Max Beerbohm’s caricature of Teixeira,
discovered later—to the subject’s delight—in
the waiting-room of an eminent gynaecologist,
emphasizes the most strongly marked
natural and acquired characteristics of his appearance:
a big nose and a liking for the fantastic
in dress. There is hardly space, in the
drawing, even for the tiny hat of the music-hall
comedian, so devastating is the sweep of
that nose, outward from the lips, up and
round, annihilating forehead and cranium
until it merges in the nape of the neck. Of
the dress no more need be said than that it
looks like a valiant attempt to live up to the
nose.</p>

<p>As this caricature has not been published in
any collection of Max Beerbohm’s drawings,
it was probably unknown to most of those who
were brought into the Intelligence Section
of the War Trade Intelligence Department,
there to be introduced to its head, to receive
the handshake and bow of a courtier and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
wonder how Tenniel could have drawn the
old sheep in <i>Alice Through the Looking-Glass</i>
without Teixeira as a model. Tall and
broad-shouldered, with thick black hair and
a white face, tortoise-shell-rimmed spectacles,
and a cigarette in a holder, taciturn, impassive
and unsmiling, Teixeira never failed to
conceal that he was more shy than his visitor.
With articulation as beautifully clear as his
writing and in words not less exquisitely
chosen than the language of his books, he
would introduce the newcomer to those with
whom he was to work. Messengers would
be despatched to bring an additional chair
and table. In the resultant confusion, the
immense, silent figure would walk away with
a heavy tread, to find that a pile of papers,
two feet high, had risen like an Indian mango
where there had been but six inches a moment
before. A voice of authority, rolling its r’s
like the rumble of distant artillery, would
telephone for more messengers; in time the
pile would dwindle until the spectacles and
then the nose and then the cigarette-holder
were visible. In time, too, the newcomer recovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
from his fright and set about learning
the business of the department.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant surprise to hear “this
Olympian creature”, as Stevenson called
Prince Florizel, addressed by Sutro as “Tex”;
and, although the first terror was disabling,
even the newcomer realized that every one in
the section seemed happy. The Olympian
creature never lost his temper, he condescended
to jokes and invented nicknames; the
appalling gravity was found to be a mask for
shyness and a disguise for bubbling absurdity.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1915 the machinery of
the blockade was still making. The department,
overworked and understaffed, was inadequately
housed in a corner of Central
Buildings, Westminster. In the autumn it
moved to Broadway House, in Tothill Street;
and one newcomer was invited to sit at Teixeira’s
table as deputy-head of the section.
Thenceforth, until the armistice, we worked
together daily, save when one or other was on
leave or ill and during the early summer of
1917 when I was sent to Washington. The
office, changing almost weekly in personnel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
underwent reconstruction when the blockade
was modified in 1918: Teixeira became secretary
to the department; I succeeded him
as head of the intelligence section; and, when
I left in 1919, he stayed behind to help in
dismantling the old machine and in assembling
a new one to supply economic information
to the peace conference.</p>

<p>Our correspondence for the last three years
of the war was restricted to the times when
one of us was away. These absences grew
more frequent as Teixeira exchanged one
illness for another. His letters present him
as a government servant rejoicing in his work,
tingling with the new sense of new responsibility
and, “from his circumstances having
been always such, that he had scarcely any
share in the real business of life”, suggesting
irresistibly a comparison with Dr. Johnson
at the sale of his friend Thrale’s brewery,
“bustling about, with an ink-horn and pen in
his button-hole, like an exciseman”. So much
of them, however, is taken up with departmental
business that I have drawn sparingly
upon them.</p>

<p>The first five months of 1916 were a time
of relatively good health for Teixeira; and
our correspondence contains little more than
an invitation, which he acknowledged in
departmental language.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>We should be glad, <span class="antiqua">replies Teixeira</span>, if this
application could come up again in say a fortnight’s
time.</i></p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 8em;"><i>A. T.</i></span><br>
<i>Trade Clearing House.</i></p>

</div>

<p>When next I was summoned for duty as a
special constable, the application was submitted
again; and Teixeira dined with me at
the Reform Club. Later in the year, though
he had been warned by William Campbell,
the greatest friend of his middle years, that a
man who laughed so much would never be
admitted to membership, I was allowed to
propose him as a candidate; and from the day
of his election he became one of the most
popular figures both in the card-room and
in the south-east corner of the big smoking-room,
where his most intimate associates gathered.</p>

<p>His hours of work, to which the first stanza
refers, have already been mentioned; his
methods call for a word or two of description.
The library in Cheltenham Terrace looked
out over the Duke of York’s School and was
lined with book-cases wherever windows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
fire-place or door permitted. The furniture
consisted of a sofa, which was used for hat-boxes
and more books; a writing-table, which
was used for anything but writing; a revolving
book-case, filled with works of reference;
and the editorial chair from the office of <i>The
Candid Friend</i>. Seating himself in dressing-gown
and slippers, between the fire-place and
the revolving book-case, Teixeira dug himself
into position: a despatch-box under his
feet raised his knees to an angle at which he
could balance a dictionary upon them, with
its edge resting on a miniature bureau; on the
dictionary rested a blotting-pad; and every
book that he needed was in reach either of his
hand or an elongated pair of “lazy-tongs”;
scissors, string, sealing-wax, india-rubber and
knives were ingeniously and menacingly suspended
from nails in the revolving book-case;
on the top stood cigarettes, matches, a paste-pot
and a vast copper ash-tub; and the colour
of his violet carpet was chosen to conceal the
occasional splashings of a violet-ink pen.
With a telephone on one side to put him in
touch with the outside world and with a bell
on the other to secure his morning coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Teixeira could work without moving until
evicted by force.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June, he was ordered to
Malvern.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>No news, <span class="antiqua">he writes on the 10th</span>, except that
I have arrived and had some tea....</i></p>

<p><i>There are hawthorns at Malvern and rhododendrons
of -dra but also the most bloodthirsty
hills. And there was an officer in the train who
told me that the feeling in Franst was most
“optimistic”.</i></p>

<p><i>The proprietress of this hotel pronounces my
name Teisheira. This must be looked into.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I s’pose I’m enjoying myself, <span class="antiqua">he writes next
day</span>. I feel very restless.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="antiqua">[My cook]</span>, I forgot to tell you, was mounting
guard over the dispatch-box like a very sentinel,
with hands duly folded: a most proper spectacle.
I nearly died, but not entirely, hunting for my
porter up and down the length of the longest
train you ever saw (I am sure this must be correct,
in view of the fact that you never did see
this particular train)....</i></p>

<p><i>This hotel is not so uncomfortable: I slept
eight hours; I have a writing-table in my room;
my bath was too hot to get into; these are signs
of human comfort, are not they? Nor is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
food nasty. Fortunately, there is not much of it.
I ordered me a bottle of Berncastler Doctor.
They brought me Liebfraumilch. I waved it
away, saying that hock was acid and gave me
gout. Then, persuaded to be a Christian, I sent
one running after it before the doctor was opened
and drank two glasses; and it was delicious; and
I have no gout.</i></p>

<p><i>Why I sit boring you with this dull stuff I do
not know: it is certainly not worth including in
the Life and Letters.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Two days of solitude set him athirst for
companionship.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Good-morning, fair sir, <span class="antiqua">he writes on
12.6.16</span>. I hope this finds you as it leaves me at
present, a little improved in health. But I would
not wish my worst enemy the weariness from
which I am suffering.... Picture me buying
useless things so that I may exchange a word
with a shopman; for no one talks to me here.
Also the weather is bitterly cold.</i></p>

</div>

<p>And next day:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have ... talked at length to a highly intelligent
Dane, with a massy pair of calves that
do credit to his pastoral country. But he has

<p>On Teixeira’s return to the department,
our correspondence was suspended until I
went to Cornwall for a week’s leave in August.
When I wrote in praise of my surroundings,
he replied with a warning:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You are probably too young ever to have heard
of ... a play-actress ... who brought a breach
of promise action ... and earned the then
record damages of £10,000. She took a cottage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
somewhere the other day and brought her mother
to live in it. The mother said, “This is just the
sort of place I like; I shall be happy here,” then
fell down the stairs and was dead in half an
hour....</i></p>

<p><i>... Remember me to the Atlantic....</i></p>

</div>

<p>The next letter contained a story from
Ireland:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Sligo, 18 August 1916.</i></p>

<p><i>... Here, in this most distressful country, we
are about to experience again the blessings of
coercion, administered by Duke, K.C., and Carson,
high priest of the cult. In Sligo, the other
day, two ladies treating each other in a public-house,
the barman intervened at the tenth drink,
saying:</i></p>

<p><i>“Stop it now; ye can’t have any more; troth,
I won’t sarve ye again. Don’t ye know it’s Martial
Law that’s on the people?”</i></p>

<p><i>Whereupon one of them enquired of the other:</i></p>

<p><i>“For the love of God, Mrs. Murphy, what’s
he talking about at all? Who’s Martial Law?”</i></p>

<p><i>To which her friend replied <span class="antiqua">sotto voce</span>:</i></p>

<p><i>“Whist, don’t be showing your ignorance,

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>As official papers accompanied every letter,
a trace of departmental style is occasionally
visible in private notes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>This morning, <span class="antiqua">he writes later</span>, I have bought

five years’ time. Alas! Still, there are hopes.</i></p>

<p>In his preface to <i>The Admirable Bashville</i>,
Bernard Shaw explains his reason for throwing
it into blank verse: “I had but a week
to write it in. Blank verse is so childishly
easy and expedious (hence, by the way,
Shakespeare’s copious output), that by adopting
it I was enabled to do within the week
what would have cost me a month in prose.”
Pressure of work sometimes drove Teixeira
to a similar expedient in rimed verse:</p>

<p>On Holy Saturday, 1917, I was asked by
the deputy-chairman whether I would represent
the department on the mission which
Mr. Balfour was taking to Washington with a
view to coordinating the war-organization of
Great Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>For the next two months Teixeira and I
communicated whenever a bag passed between
the British Embassy and the Foreign
Office, overflowing into a brief journal betweenwhiles.
He also disposed of my varied
correspondence with uniform discretion and
with a courage that only failed him when unknown
mothers asked him if I would stand
sponsor to their children.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The enquiries into the cause of your absence,

<p>The figure of Max Beerbohm’s caricature
is seen in the following paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have ordered eight new coloured shirts,
bringing the total up to 23. Then I have about
a dozen black-and-white shirts; and only seven
dress-shirts, I find. This makes 42 in all. My
father’s theory was that no gentleman should
have fewer than eighty shirts to his name.
Times have changed; and we are a petty and
pettyfogging generation of mankind. On the
other hand, I have 33 ties, exclusive of white
ties. I feel almost sure that my father did not
have so many as that. And I outdo him utterly
in boot-trees, of which I have just ordered a pair
to be marked “L8” and “R8,” meaning thereby
that it is my eighth pair. <span class="antiqua">Sursum corda.</span></i></p>

<p>Teixeira believed with almost complete
sincerity that he would die on 21 April 1917.
The origin of this belief he never explained to
me; and I do not know whether he confided
it to others. This accounts for the following
entry:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Shall I live, I wonder, till the 22nd, to write

the horrible Widow’s Song which Vesta Victoria
used to sing. I will start the next page with the

<p>In the middle of May I cabled to Teixeira
in code, asking him to forward no more
letters; and I did not hear from him again
until my return to England in the second week
of June.</p>

<p>As soon as I was ready to take his place, he
went to Harrogate for a cure and remained
there for six weeks. For part of the time I
took his place in another sense of the phrase.
At the end of July the Air Board commandeered
my flat; and, until I could find, decorate
and furnish another, Teixeira and his
wife most kindly placed their house at my
disposal. This will explain the following
extract:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Harrogate: 15 July, 1917.</i></p>

<p><i>Here is the key. Come in when you like, make
yourself as comfortable as you can and forgive
all deficiencies. I feel a compunction at not having
the physical energy to “clear” things a bit for
you; but there you are....</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have started my cure, <span class="antiqua">he writes on 18.7.17</span>,
which promises to be a most strenuous, arduous
and tedious affair. I have to take daily two
soda-water tumblers of strong sulphur water and
two ordinary tumblers of warm magnesia water;
and on alternate days (a) a Nauheim bath and
(b) a hot-air bath....</i></p>

<p><i>It is raining steadily. This doesn’t matter.
But that sulphur-water, on an empty stomach, at
8 a.m.! Two-and-twenty ounces of it, hot! The
stench of it! It is said to remind one of rotten
eggs; but, as I have never smelt a rotten egg, it
reminds me of nothing and only suggests hell.</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sugar seems to have been more scarce in
Harrogate than in London; and Teixeira’s
appeals and contrivances were always pathetic
and sometimes frantic.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My wife did manage to get half a pound of it
flung at her head this morning, <span class="antiqua">he writes on
19.7.17</span>. I had so entirely forgotten the essential
rudeness of the people of Yorkshire that its
discovery came upon me as an utter surprise. I
amuse myself by overcoming it with smiles.
Smiles are unfamiliar symptoms to them and take
them aback.</i></p>

<p><i>You may tell Sutro that I have bought a dozen
silk collars.</i></p>

</div>

<p>After weary weeks of nauseating treatment,
he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>It will be an awful sell if this cure ends without
doing me good. Still I always hope. Whatever
happens I shall want at least a week’s after-cure
which I should probably take here: simply a rest
and air, without any waters or baths. But what
is your Cornish date?</i></p>

</div>

<p>I replied, 27.7.17.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>By this time you will have seen that our minds
have been working on parallel lines towards the
same conclusion that an after-cure is quite essential.
It will suit me perfectly well to stay here
until, and including, Friday the 24th, or later if
you like. My Cornish arrangements are quite
fluid....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>For all your pagan pose, <span class="antiqua">he writes</span>, you are a
fine old Irish Christian gentleman, as is proved
by your suggestion of an after-cure, dictated no
doubt at the identical moment when I was writing
my answer to it. At any rate, I prefer to
think of you as a Christian brother rather than
as a Corsican brother. As I said, I shall probably
take that after-cure, but take it at Harrogate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
which is about as bracing a spot as any in
the three kingdoms. To go straight to the sea
might set up my rheumatism again, if indeed it
is suppressed; there is no sign yet of that desiderandum....</i></p>

</div>

<p>It is necessary to insert my letter of 30.7.17
in order to explain Teixeira’s reply to it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I went home for the week-end, <span class="antiqua">I wrote</span>, and
travelled up this morning with C. H. C. has a
new and most amusing game. It consists of inviting
people to stay with him for the week-end
and encouraging them to bathe in the river
Thames and only disclosing, when the damage
has been done, that the bed of that ancient river
is richly studded with broken bottles. There
was a small boy in the carriage with one badly
injured foot as a result of C.’s pleasantry. I did
a conspicuous St. Christopher stunt and carried
the boy on my shoulders the entire length of the
arrival platform at Paddington....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I, <span class="antiqua">Teixeira answers, 30.7.17</span>, once carried
Willie Crosthwait, then aged 14, the whole
length of the Euston departure platform. That
beats you (and perhaps caused the best part of my
present troubles). He is now an army chaplain;
and I sit moaning at Harrogate.</i></p>

<p>My eviction took place in the first week of
August; and on 3.8.17 I wrote to Teixeira:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I am thinking of moving to Chelsea on Tuesday....
You may remember a story of Benjamin
Jowett in connection with two undergraduates
who persisted in staying up at Balliol
throughout the Long Vacation. Jowett, by way
of gently dislodging them, insisted first that they
should attend Chapel daily. The undergraduates
grumbled, but obeyed. Jowett, seeing that his
first attack had failed, arranged with the kitchen
authorities that the food served to these recalcitrant
young scholars should be entirely uneatable,
and in the course of time their spirit was
so much broken that they left him and Balliol in
peace. He is reported to have said, as he
watched them driving down to the station:
“That sort goeth not forth but by prayer and
fasting.” So with me. I have manfully withstood
the stalwart labourers who break walls
down all round me throughout the night; but,
when the porters are paid off, the maids deprived
of their rooms, the hot-water supply disconnected
and the gas cut off at the main, I feel that I may
retire with dignity and the full honours of
war....</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Make yourself as comfortable in Chelsea as
you can, <span class="antiqua">he answered on 4.8.17</span>. As at present
advised, we return on Wednesday fortnight, the
22nd....</i></p>

<p><i>The days here speed past on wings, thanks to
their monotony. Waters at 8; again at 10.30;
a bath or baths at 11; lunch at 1.30; a jog-trot
drive from 3 to 4; bridge; dinner at 7.30; massage
at 9; all this with unfailing regularity. I
believe far more in my masseuse (she lives at this
house) than in my doctor. It will amuse your
father to hear that this genius is prescribing for
me in the matter of rheumatism, neuritis and
fibrositis in the arm without having once had my
shirt off! I make suggestions, at the instance of
the masseuse, and he promptly annexes them as
his own:</i></p>

<p><i>“Tell me, doctor, may I do so-and-so?”</i></p>

<p><i>“You <span class="antiqua">are</span> to do so-and-so; and this very day!”</i></p>

<p><i>The doctors here generally have the very
worst name; but there is nobody to pull them up
or show them up.</i></p>

<p><i>The place teems with people whom I know and
don’t want to see.</i></p>

<p><i>The rain it raineth every day and all day....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My cure is now over, <span class="antiqua">he writes on 12.8.17</span>;
it has been long and costly; it has done me no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
good at all. Indeed my main affliction is worse;
certain movements of the right arm which were
possible with comparative ease before I came
down are now nearly impossible. On Saturday,
at the final consultation, when I took leave of my
doctor and paid him five guineas, he told me for
the first time that I have no neuritis but that I
have bursitis. All the while, mark you, he has

to know, however, that I have no arthritis.

would call a hi-tiddlyhitis high old time....</i></p>

<p>A week later I went again to Cornwall on
leave.</p>

was infinitely distressed about it. Treat yourself

<p>Later he added:</p>

<p><i>Be careful not to honour the Atlantic with
more than one immersion a day....</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i><span class="antiqua">And, 30.8.17.</span> I am exceedingly busy, but
I am enjoying it all. My health is as bad as ever

bloom of roses and the stains of coffee on your
cheeks. So make up your mind to sleep and do
it....</i></p>

</div>

<p>In the first week of September there began
the most persistent series of air-raids that occurred
at any stage during the war.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Last night, <span class="antiqua">Teixeira writes, 5.9.17</span>, was
made hideous by a pack of confounded Germans
who came over London and created no end of a
din. I looked out of the window, saw one shell
burst in a south-easterly direction, debated
whether to go below or remain in bed and remained
in bed.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="antiqua">[My cook]</span>, from her basement, appears to
have obtained a much clearer aural view:</i></p>

<p><i>“Didn’t you hear them two raiders firing
bom-m-ms at each other, sir?”</i></p>

<p><i>There spoke your Sinn Feiner: they were both
raiders to her. The row lasted for over two
hours; and I feel an utter wreck. Lord knows
what mischief the brutes have done this time.</i></p>

<p><i>Vale et nos ama.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Next day, in a letter dated, <i>City of Dreadful
Nights</i>, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Last night no air-raid was possible, because of
an appalling thunderstorm, which kept me awake
for another three hours. If you have ever heard
thunder rolling for fifty seconds without intercession
and giving sixty of these rolls to the
hour, you will know the sort of thunderstorm it
was.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This description prompts him to an anecdote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>“Then there’s Roche, the resident magistrate.
Don’t go shooting Roche now ... unless it’s by
accident. What does he look like? Well, if
ye’ve ever seen a half-drowned rat, with a grey
worsted muffler round its neck, then ye know the
kind of man Roche is!”—Speech quoted before
the Parnell Commission.</i></p>

</div>

<p>On my return from Cornwall, my flat was
not yet ready for me, but the Teixeiras’ hospitality
allowed me to continue staying with
them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You will be as welcome on Thursday night as
peace at Christmas, <span class="antiqua">wrote Teixeira, 9.9.17</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
<span class="antiqua">[My cook]</span> is away on a holiday and there is a
possibility that she will not be back by then; and
in the meantime there is nobody else. You may,
therefore, have to submit to a modicum of discomfort:
... your boots will probably have to
accumulate to some extent before they are cleaned
on the larger scale. You have so many boots,
however, that I venture to hope that this will
not incommode you unduly.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This welcome was seasoned later by a story
which Teixeira invented, describing his
efforts to dislodge me. According to this, he
used to fall resonantly from his bedroom to his
study at 5.0 each morning and, if this failed to
rouse me, he would mount the stairs again
and continue to throw himself down until I
waked. At 6.0 a cup of tea would be brought
me; at 7.0 the morning paper; at 8.0 my
letters. When I went to my bath at 8.30,
Teixeira used to assert that he flung my
clothes into a suit-case, tiptoed downstairs
and laid the case on the doorstep. His tactics
failed because I only waited until he was
locked in the bathroom before creeping down
and retrieving the case.</p>

<p>As our leave was over for the year, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
was no further exchange of letters save when
one or other was absent from our department.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have read the new Maeterlinck play<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>—a

third act and with it your regard for M’s feelings;
then rewrite it with a little passion, a great
deal of fear and unlimited un-understanding
horror. The invasion of Belgium wasn’t a
Greek tragedy where the afflicted prosed and
philosophised—with a chorus dilating on cattle-yas;
it was noisy, bloody and, above all, unbelievable.
Maeterlinck has brought no nightmare
into it....</i></p>

<p>In 1918 Teixeira’s health had so much improved
that he was able to dispense with all
violent and disabling cures.</p>

<p>This was the period when he was, socially,
in greatest request. I introduced him, in the
spring, to Mr. and Mrs. Asquith, who shewed
him much hospitality and great kindness
from this time until his death. His leaves
were now usually spent with them at Sutton
Courtney; but, since he required to take little
or no sick-leave, the number of letters exchanged
in this year is small.</p>

<p>At the armistice, he left the Intelligence
Section to become secretary to the department;
and, though we worked in the same
building for two or three months more, I
naturally saw less of him than when we shared
the same table. The last communication that
passed between us as colleagues, like the first,
written three years before, contained an invitation.
Its form must be explained by reference
to Stevenson’s and Osborne’s <i>Wrong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Box</i>. Rudyard Kipling has mentioned, in
<i>A Diversity of Creatures</i>, the sublime brotherhood
to whom this book is a second Bible.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I remembered,” [he writes in <i>The Vortex</i>],
“a certain Joseph Finsbury who delighted the
Tregonwell Arms ... with nine ... versions
of a single income of two hundred pounds, placing
the imaginary person in—but I could not
recall the list of towns further than ‘London,
Paris, Bagdad, and Spitzbergen.’ This last I
must have murmured aloud, for the Agent-General
suddenly became human and went on: ‘Bussoran,
Heligoland, and the Scilly Islands’—‘What?’
growled Penfentenyou. ‘Nothing,’ said
the Agent-General, squeezing my hand affectionately.
‘Only we have just found out that we
are brothers.... I’ve got it. Brighton, Cincinnati
and Nijni-Novgorod!’ God bless
<span class="allsmcap">R. L. S.</span><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>...” One of the greatest living authorities
on <i>The Wrong Box</i> was a member of the
Reform Club; and, on joining, Teixeira found it
necessary to his self-protection to study the most
aptly-quoted work in the world.</p>

<p>My invitation was couched in the cryptic terms
of the brotherhood:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

</div>

<p>On leaving the department early in 1919, I
saw and heard little of Teixeira until he invited
me to collaborate in the translation
of <i>The Tour</i>. Occasional divergencies of
opinion about translating Latin words in the
English rendering of a Dutch novel had the
very desirable result of making Teixeira set
out some few of the principles which he followed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Couperus sends me this postcard, <span class="antiqua">he writes,
29.4.18</span>:</i></p>

<p><i>“Amice,</i></p>

<p><i>“You are of course at liberty to act according
to your taste and judgement. I do not however
understand the thing: in every novel treating of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
antiquity the classical word sometimes gives a
nuance to the untranslatable local colour. And
every novelist feels this: See <span class="antiqua">Quo Vadis</span>, in
Jeremiah Curtius’ translation. However, do as
you think proper.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>“Yours,</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>“L. C.”</i></p>

<p><i>He has us on the hip with his Jeremiah Curtius.
And I feel more than ever that you were too drastic
in your views and I too weak in yielding to
them....</i></p>

<p><i>We should always guard ourselves against the
bees in our bonnets. When I produced Zola’s
<span class="antiqua">Heirs of Rabourdin</span>, the stage-manager said his
play-actors couldn’t pronounce Monsieur, Madame
and Mademoiselle to his liking: might he
try how it would sound with Mr., Mrs., and Miss
Rabourdin? He tried!</i></p>

<p><i>If your principle were carried to any length,
you would have to call a pagoda a tower, a jinrickshaw
a buggy, a café a coffee-house, a gendarme
a policeman (i.e. a <span class="antiqua">sergent-de-ville</span>), a
toga a cloak, a gondola a wherry, an Alpenstock
an Alpine stick, a ski a snowshoe: one could go
on for ever!</i></p>

<p><i>Yet I am ever yours,</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Tex.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>In the spring and summer of 1919 our
letters became more frequent. Though Teixeira
spent most of his time in his department, I
employed the first months of liberation in
staying with friends. The translation of <i>The
Tour</i> went on apace; and arrangements were
made for the English publication of <i>Old
People and the Things That Pass</i>. If he had
given his readers no other book by Couperus
or by any other writer, he would still have
established two reputations with this.</p>

<p>A letter from Bexhill, dated 2.7.19,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
touches on one general principle of translating:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... With all deference, a translator’s first
duty is not to translate. His first duty is to love
God, honour the king and hate the Germans.
His next duty is to produce a version corresponding
as near as may be with what an English original
writer, if he were writing that particular
book, would set down. His last duty is to translate
every blessed word of the original....</i></p>

</div>

<p>Next day he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i><span class="antiqua">T. B. [Thornton Butterworth]</span> is taking “O.

<p>On Peace Day, in a letter dated from Finsbury
Circus, Teixeira writes:</p>

<p><i>Here sit I, putting in four or five hours before

Jane Wells at Easton Glebe and reading <span class="antiqua">Quo

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p><i>... This is interesting: <span class="antiqua">[the author]</span> says
that in Nero’s day it was already becoming a
stunt among the Romans to call the gods by their
Greek Names. Tiberius was not so much earlier—was
he?—than Nero that the practice might
not have begun even then. If so, we can let
Couperus have his way and retain those few
names. They are very few, I think. I can remember
at the moment only Aphrodite and Zeus
and possibly Eros. It may be that Juno is mentioned
as Hera, but I doubt it.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a charming garden, with a most beautifully

<p><i>... I am here; yes, but how did I get here?
I am here; yes, but shall I ever get away? I

boat-deck with her (but without an overcoat),
watching the dawn until I was chilled to the
marrow and any other man would have been
delirious with pneumonia. The breakfast-car
train had left, so we took a later one from Dublin.
Being faced with the prospect of waiting
2½ hours at Clones, I got out at Drogheda to
send a telegram to the Leslies, begging them to
meet us there by car. Unhappily, the train went
on without me, bearing away my young and very
lovely charge, my suit-case, my despatch-box, my
umbrella and my hat. I was left with a pair of
gloves and my charge’s ticket.... I bought
myself a cap of 4/6 and a clean collar for

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The one and only thing that the Fortunate
Youth appeared to me not to possess will reach
you in a little registered packet to-morrow evening....
You are to accept it as a token of the

<p><i>That was a very jolly party on Wednesday:
I enjoyed everything: the gay and kindly company,
the admirable foodstuffs, even the music;
and, if it be true, as I told you, that Covent
Garden has shrunk in size since my young days,
I am compelled to confess that your box was a
larger than I ever saw before.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>At this season of excess, <span class="antiqua">he writes on Christmas
Day</span>, I am allowed to indulge my passion
for chocolates, but not to buy any for myself;
and it was most thoughtful of you to pander to
my taste. Thank you ever so much. And thank
you also for your good wishes....</i></p>

<p><i>I must be off to mass, but not without first
begging you to hand your mother and sister my
best wishes for a happy New Year. As to you,
I shall see or talk to you before then....
My young Sinn Feiner has written a novel<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
which to my mind is a most remarkable production
and which will have to be read by you at all
costs. It is published in Dublin; and it is doubtful
whether a single other copy will find its way
to this foreign land.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In April Teixeira and his wife went to
Hove: and on 27.4.20 he writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p><i>It is blowing what-you-may-call-it here: ’arf a

we are well and send our love.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Commenting on a house-party which I had
described, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p>The next letter was from his wife and
brought the news that Teixeira’s health had
taken an unexpected turn for the worse. His
life was not in immediate danger, but henceforward
he must regard himself as an invalid
and must work under the conditions imposed
by his doctor.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as he was well enough to be moved,
Teixeira came up from Hove and, after a
few days in Chelsea, went to a nursing-home
in Crowborough for the summer.</p>

<p>Nothing is more characteristic of him than
that the first message he sent after the beginning
of his illness was one of reassurance
and optimism:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Sent you a wire this morning, <span class="antiqua">he writes</span>, lest
you be seriously distressed. Really much better
after nine hours’ sleep.... I expect I shall be
quite well by Saturday, when we return but I
shall have to be jolly careful....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Thanks for your letters, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 8.5.20,
when we were arranging to meet</span>. Nothing you
can do for me at present except converse with
me in the form of: Tex. Very short questions:
Stephen. Very long answers. I’m getting
plaguily impatient at the slowness of my recovery:
it’s very wrong, wicked and impatient of me.</i></p>

<p><i>I enclose.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p><i>A. Two lines from your favourite “poet”
(save the Mark Tapley)!</i></p>

<p><i>B. Some wedding-effusions which remind me
that Burne-Jones, when they told him that marriage
was a lottery, said:</i></p>

<p><i>“Then it ought to be made illegal.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>While undergoing his rest-cure, he not
infrequently communicated with me by
means of annotations to the letters which I
wrote him. His comments are given in
parenthesis.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I ... went to see <span class="antiqua">As You Like It</span> at the Lyric
Theatre, Hammersmith, <span class="antiqua">I wrote, 15.5.20</span>. It
is a good production but an uncommonly bad
play, like so many of that author’s. If any
dramatist of the present day served up that kind
of musical comedy without the music, but with
all the existing purple patches, I wonder what
your modern critic would make of it.</i></p>

<p><i>(Laurence Irving used to go about saying,
“Teixeira says that Shakespeare wrote only one
decent play: <span class="antiqua">Timon of Athens!</span> Wha-art d’ye
think of that? The mun’s mud!” Talking of
Shakespeare, if you want to laugh, really to
laugh, <span class="antiqua">ce qu’on appelle</span> to laugh, read (you will
never see it acted) a stage-play called <span class="antiqua">Titus Andronicus</span>....)</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p><i>(Help! A man waved to me on the lawn
y’day: an Ebrew Jew ... had motored down to
see his sister here; told me I’d find her very
“bright.” She’s fifty <span class="antiqua">bien sonnés</span>. Told him I’d
feel too shy to talk to anybody for weeks. But
I’m lending her books. Help!)</i></p>

</div>

<p>Strictly limited in the amount of work
which he was allowed to do, Teixeira
in these weeks read voraciously; and his
letters of this period contain almost the only
critical judgements that I was able to extract
from him.</p>

<p>On 25.5.20. he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Was Pearsall Smith the inventor of the pedigree
tracing the descent of the English from the
ten lost tribes of Israel?</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Isaac</i><br>

<p><i>What was the other famous book, besides
<span class="antiqua">Erewhon</span>, which George Meredith (whom I am
beginning to dislike almost as much as Henry
James and Pearl Craigie) caused Smith, Elder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
&amp; Co. to reject? Was it <span class="antiqua">Treasure Island</span> or
something quite different?</i></p>

<p><i>Which Samuel Butlers am I to buy now? I
have (in the order of which I have enjoyed
them):</i></p>


<ul><li>The Way of all Flesh</li>

<li>The Notebooks</li>
<li>Erewhon Revisited</li>
<li>Erewhon</li>
</ul>

<p><i>The machinery part of the last-named bored
me; the philosophy also; and I fear I missed much
of the irony. But the style! It’s unbeaten.
It’s as good as Defoe. It knocks Stevenson silly
because it’s so utterly natural. Hats off to that
for style.</i></p>

<p><i>Should I enjoy <span class="antiqua">The Humour of Homer</span>,

wasted on me? What is <span class="antiqua">The Fair Haven</span> about?
I don’t want to read Butler’s religious views—all
you Britons think and talk and write much too
much about religion—nor his views on evolution:
he is too much in sympathy, I gather, with that
dishonest fellow, Darwin.</i></p>

<p><i>What shall I read of that same Darwin, so
that I may do my own chuckling? Please name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the best two or three, in their order as written.</i></p>

<p><i>Where shall I find the quarrels between Huxley
and Darwin? That accomplished gyurl, my
stepdaughter, had read all about them before
she was sixteen but was unable to point me to
the book.</i></p>

<p><i>At your leisure, my dear Stephen, answer me
all these questions. As you see, I’m making
progress. I have neither capacity nor inclination
(thank God) for work yet, but I can read day
without end.</i></p>

<p><i>Pearsall Smith’s <span class="antiqua">Stories from the Old Testament</span>
would amuse you. It’s too dear; but it
would amuse you, in parts.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In discussing Darwin’s books, I suggested
that Teixeira should find out whether the
members of his church were encouraged to
read them.</p>

<p>He replies, 28.5.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... I am very glad that Darwin is on the
Index and I hope that this interferes with his
royalties....</i></p>

</div>

<p>And on 2.6.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Pray bear with a postcard. I noticed that
you used “detour” on two occasions.... I sympathize.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
There’s no English equivalent save
Tony Lumpkin’s seriocomic “circumbendibus.”
But I meant to tell you of my recent discovery
that Chesterton uses “detour,” <span class="antiqua">sic</span> without an accent
or italics. And it’s well worth considering.
I, for my part, have made up my mind to adopt
it in future, by analogy with “depot” and, for
that matter, “tour,” which is never italicized.</i></p>

<p><i>I also intend to adopt your “judgement”....</i></p>

<p><i>What a lot one can still write for a penny!</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Tex.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In acknowledging one of his translations,
I wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Two of my worst faults as a reader are that
I always finish a book which I have begun and
always begin a book which has been presented
to me by the author or translator.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Teixeira comments:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>(I always thought highly of your brain till
now. I regret to tell you that the only other
human being who has ever confessed that vice to
me is J. T. Grein’s mother.... Drop that vice.
Why, I once “began” to read the Bible!...)</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>With most of your criticisms I agree, <span class="antiqua">my letter
continued. Teixeira had been reading the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
manuscript of some short stories;</span> though there
are one or two points on which I remain adamant.
If you wish to shorten your life, ask any Coldstreamer
whether he belongs to the Coldstreams.
It is always either the Coldstream Guards or the
Coldstream....</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><i>(I suspected you of being right, but I was not
ashamed to ask you. You may or may not have
observed how much less of a snob I am than most
of the people you strike. Cricketing terms,
nautical terms, military terms, Latin quantities,
those endless excuses for the worst forms of British
snobbery, all leave me cold.)</i></p>

</div>

<p>In discussing methods of work, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>(... It will interest you to know that Oscar
Wilde dropped all his pleasures when he wrote
his plays; retired into rooms in St. James’ Place,
hired <span class="antiqua">ad hoc</span>, to write the first line; and did not
leave them till he had written the last. And one
of them at least, <span class="antiqua">The Importance</span>, was a perfect
work of art, whatever one may think of the
others.)</i></p>

</div>

<p>Though he enjoyed his rest-cure, it gave him—he
complained—no news to communicate:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You’re not interested in my brown dog and I
speak to no one else.</i></p>

</div>

<p>On my pointing out that I could not be
interested in an animal of which I had hitherto
not heard, Teixeira wrote, 4.6.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... It must have been my morbid delicacy
that prevented me, knowing your dislike of dogs,
from mentioning the brown dog before. As a
man gains strength, he loses delicacy: that explains
though it does not excuse my late reference
to him. He is an Irish terrier, endowed with a
vast sense of humour, who runs about on three
legs (which is one more than I, who am eighteen
times his age, can boast) and plays with me from
ten till half-past six (when I go to bed). He
saves me from all boredom and I am grateful to
him....</i></p>

<p><i>Little by little I am beginning to itch for
work.... I can’t work yet; but I regard the itching
as a good sign. And I no longer find these
longish letters so much of a strain. It takes a
lot to kill a Portugal.</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><i>Bring me to the gentle remembrance of your
charming host and hostess. I wonder if I shall
ever meet either of them at one of your pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
dinners again. I wonder if I shall ever dine
with you again at all....</i></p>

</div>

<p>On 8.6.20 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... I send you a letter from ... a Beaumont
master and scholastic in minor orders.
Apart from its nice misspelling, its noble, broad-minded
casuistry will explain to you why I love
the Church, as it explains to me why you hate it.
<span class="antiqua">Cependant</span> I suppose that I must set to work and
read me a little Darwin.</i></p>

<p><i>I am making fair progress, as my recent letters
must have proved to you. But I do not yet
consider myself near enough to complete recovery
to return to town....</i></p>

</div>

<p>In June Teixeira was created a Chevalier
of the Order of Leopold II. My letter of
congratulation was annotated on this and
other subjects:</p>

<p>Referring to a criticism of <i>Kipps</i>, I had
written:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>It is excellent stuff, and I always regard Wells
as being one of the ... greatest ... comedy-writers.
But I always feel that in <span class="antiqua">Kipps</span> and all
the earlier books he is only working up to <span class="antiqua">Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Polly</span>, which is the most exquisite thing that he
has done in that line.</i></p>

<p><i>(I have read both down here and prefer <span class="antiqua">Kipps</span>.
The phrases underlined, quoted in the <span class="antiqua">Times</span>
notice (attached) of Wells’ Polly-Kippsian “<span class="antiqua">History
of the World</span>” reminds me irresistibly of
the old lady who, witnessing a performance of
“<span class="antiqua">Anthony and Cleopatra</span>,” by your Mr. Shakespeare
or our Mr. Shaw, observed: “How different
from the home life of our dear queen!”)</i></p>

<p><i>... Let me offer you—a trifle belatedly perhaps—my
congratulations on your new dignity.</i></p>

<p><i>(“Thanks.” A. Kipps)</i></p>

<p><i>Certainly you should tell the <span class="antiqua">[Belgian]</span> Ambassador
that it is not only inconvenient but impossible
for you to be invested in person and that he
must send you the warrant and insignia....</i></p>

<p><i>Did I ever tell you the story of Mr. G.’s search
for a decoration? The Kaiser refused to give
him one on any consideration, and he therefore
toured Europe, lending or giving money to one
government after another in the hope of being
ultimately rewarded with the 4th class of the
Speckled Pig. In every court he was promised
his decoration, but, when he presented himself
for the investiture, the court officials turned from
him with just that expression of loathing and
nausea which he had formerly observed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
face of the Kaiser. It was only when he reached
Bulgaria that he found the Czar and his court less
squeamish. On payment of a considerable solatium
he was invested with the 19th class of the
Expiring Porpoise and returned in triumph to his
native Stettin. Here, however, his troubles were
only beginning, as he was unable to obtain permission
to wear the Expiring Porpoise at any
public function in Germany. Seeing that he had
paid one considerable sum to the Bulgarian Czar
and another to the firm of jewellers, who substituted
diamonds for the paste of the jewel he
felt, naturally enough, that he was receiving little
value for his lavish expenditure. Bulgaria, it
seemed, was the only country where the Expiring
Porpoise could be worn. Accordingly he returned
to Sofia and paid a further sum to be invited
to the banquet which the burgomaster of
Sofia was giving on the Czar’s birthday. Here
he was at length rewarded for so many months of
disappointment and neglect. Before the soup
had been served, the Czar had hurried round to
his place and was kissing him on both cheeks.
“My dear old friend!” said he, “No, you are
not to call me ‘sir’; henceforth it is ‘Fritz’ and
‘Ferdinand’ between us, is it not? How long it
is since last I saw you! I have been waiting to
express my heart-felt regret for the unpardonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
carelessness of my Chamberlain. When it was
too late and you had left Sofia (I feared for
ever), my Chamberlain discovered that you had
been invested with the 19th Class of the Expiring
Porpoise. You must have thought me mad, for
no sane man would offer the 19th class to a person
of your distinction. It was the 1st class that
I intended. This bauble that I am wearing round
my neck to-night. Tell me, my dear Fritz, that it
is not too late for me to repair my error.” With
that word the Czar removed the collar and jewel
from his own neck and slipped it over the head
of G. taking in exchange G.’s despised collar and
jewel of the 19th class. It was only when our
friend returned to his hotel that he discovered
the new jewel to be of the most unfinished paste,
as cheap or cheaper than the paste which he had
previously removed at such expense from the
jewel of the 19th class.</i></p>

<p><i>(This is a splendid story.)</i></p>

<p><i>I am afraid, <span class="antiqua">I added</span>, that I have no idea who
is the official to whom you apply for leave to
wear these things....</i></p>

<p><i>(My dear Stephen, you had better here and
now adopt as your maxim what I said to Browning
soon after he had engaged my services on
behalf of H.M.G.: “I yield to no man living
in my ignorance on every subject under the sun.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
You outdo and outvie me. You never know
anything. In other words, you know nothing.
But I’ll wager that these are worn without permission.
What’s the penalty? <span class="antiqua">The Morning
Post</span> to-day names a couple of dozen to whom
it’s been granted.)</i></p>

</div>

<p>Evidently feeling that I was living too
much alone, Teixeira enclosed a copy of <i>The
Times’</i> list of forthcoming dances:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>Don’t wait for invitations, <span class="antiqua">he urged in a postscript</span>.
Ring the top bell and walk inside.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>The next letter needs to have Teixeira’s use
of the word palimpsest explained. His
good-nature in reading his friends’ manuscripts
was inexhaustible. I never intended
him to do more than give me a general
opinion; but his critical vision was microscopic,
and he filled the margins with questions
and comments. In returning me one
manuscript, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have made some 800 notes, of which 600 are
purely frivolous. Six are worth serious attention.</i></p>

</div>

<p>While this textual scrutiny was quite invaluable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Teixeira seldom gave that general
opinion of which I always felt in most need
at the moment when I had lately finished a
book and was unable to regard it with detachment.
Accordingly, the manuscript, on leaving
him, was usually sent to another friend,
who commented not only on the text but also
on the marginalia. As her occasional controversies
with Teixeira (expressed in such
minutes as:</p>

<p>“Pull yourself together, Mr. T!”</p>

<p>“You men! One’s as bad as the other,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Never mind what Mr. T. says, Stephen:
<i>I</i> understand.”</p>

<p>“I <i>wish</i> my brain worked as quickly as
that.”)</p>

<p class="noindent">and with me invited rejoinders, the first version
of a manuscript sometimes took on the
appearance of a contentious departmental
file. It was in this form that Teixeira called
it a palimpsest.</p>

<p>On 22.6.20 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Thanks for your letter and the palimpsest....
I’ve studied it amid distressing circumstances, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
a long-chair, on a lawn, beneath the sun, surrounded
by breezes and patients, who being forbidden
to speak to me, dare not help me to collect
the scattered pages....</i></p>

<p><i>Lady D. is another of England’s darlings. In
the first place, she nearly always agrees with me
and there she’s right: I have told you time after
time that, if only everybody would agree with
me, the world would be an infinitely sweeter
place. In the second place, she dislikes Browning
almost as much as I do. No one can dislike
him quite so much; but she certainly disapproves
of your particular taste in extracts from the burjoice
mountebank’s rhymed works.</i></p>

<p><i>I can understand that she sometimes unsettles
you by condemning you for the quite logical behaviour
of the male characters in your trilogy:
you might meet this by presenting her with a
copy of <span class="antiqua">Thus spake Zarathustra</span> in addition to
those pencils which will mark which you already
had in mind for her. On the other hand, I think
that you may safely take her word for it when
she says:</i></p>

<p><i>“Oh, Stephen, women aren’t like this!”</i></p>

<p><i>Send me more! Send me more!</i></p>

</div>

<p>In a letter of 22.6.20, he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p><i>To-morrow I make my way up to Oxford for
the House Gaudy but before leaving I may find a
moment to report my movements.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Teixeira comments:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have heard of the House Beautiful but never
of the House Gaudy. Now don’t be a British
snob but answer like a little Irish gentleman, as
I should answer if you asked me what “acht-en-tachtig
Achtergracht” mean in Dutch. Of
course, working it out in the light of my own intelligence,
I feel that, if “House” is an Oxford
sobriquet for Christ Church and “gaudy” Oxford
slang for a merrymaking of sorts, you ought to
have suppressed that capital G and written “the
House gaudy,” in distinction from the Balliol
gaudy, the Magdalen gaudy, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>You are not a Hottentot (Loud cheers), but
you are as fond of capital letters as a Hottentot
is of glass beads.</i></p>

<p><i>I’m feeling rather full of beans to-day ...
(as you perceive.)...</i></p>

</div>

<p>The improvement was visibly maintained
in his letter of 25.6.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Thanks for your two letters of the 23rd and
24th instant postum. Don’t start; instant postum
is the ridiculous name of the toothsome beverage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
which my specialist ordered me to take
instead of tea or coffee....</i></p>

<p><i>I jump at the chance of playing the schoolmaster
in the matter of those capital letters. It
is too utterly jolly finding you in a compliant
mood....</i></p>

<p><i>My rule and yours might well be to start with
a definite prejudice against capital letters in the
middle of a sentence, combined with a resolve
never to use them if it can be avoided. Having
taken up this firm standpoint, we can afford and
we can begin to make concessions. For instance,
my heart leapt with joy, nearly twenty years
ago, when the founders of the <span class="antiqua">Burlington Review</span>
decided to abolish all capitals to adjectives, to
print “french, german, egyptian, persian,” etc.
You have no idea how well this affected the page.
But what is all right in a majestic review (or was
it magazine, by the way?) like the <span class="antiqua">Burlington</span>
may look ultraprecious in a novel. Therefore I
concede French, German, etc. Only remember
that it is a concession, a concession to Anglo-American
vulgarity. A Frenchman writes (and
that not invariably: I mean, not every Frenchman).
“Un Français les Anglais,” but (invariably)
“L’elan français, le rosbif anglais”. The
Germans and Danes begin all nouns with a capital
(as the English did, in some centuries), but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
no adjectives whatever. The Italians, Norwegians
and Swedes have no capitals to their adjectives;
the Dutch are gradually discarding
them; they are discarded entirely in scientists’
Latin: the Narbonne Lycosa (a certain spider of
the Tarantula genus) in Latin becomes <span class="antiqua">Lycosa
narbonniensis</span>....</i></p>

<p><i>Your question about “high mass” is, involuntarily,
not quite fair. Mass quite conceivably
comes within the category of such words as State
and a few others, which are spelt with a capital
in one sense and not in another.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> I write “going
to mass” (no French catholic would write “allant
à la Messe!”) and I see no reason why catholics
should write Mass except in a technical work.
They would write “the Host” because of the real
presence; but I see no more reason for the Mass
than for Matins or Compline. Obviously, it
is different in a technical work in translating
Fabre, I speak of a Wasp, a Spider, a Beetle; in
translating Couperus, I do not....</i></p>

<p><i>“The Colonel, the Major, the Vicar,” in a
novel; don’t they set your teeth on edge? As
well write about the Postmistress of the village.</i></p>

<p><i>When in doubt, as I wrote to you on the subject
of the hyphenated nouns, take little Murray<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
for your guide. He has the sense to begin the
vast, the immense majority of his words with a
lower-case letter. And there are doubtful
words: Titanic, Cyclopean. I never know these
without turning ’em up for myself.</i></p>

<p><i>To sum up:</i></p>

<p><i>(a) take a firm stand against capitals generally;</i></p>

<p><i>(b) be prepared to make moderate (i.e.
grudging,) concessions;</i></p>

<p><i>(c) have little Murray at your elbow.</i></p>

<p>After so long a letter, Teixeira contented
himself with a few annotations to one next
day.</p>

<p>On my telling him that I had congratulated
a common friend of his son’s “blue”, he interposed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>I would write to A. P. if I knew what a
“blue” was; but I really have not the remotest
idea. Word of honour, I’m not conniegilchristing.
I presume it has to do with cricket; and
it’s a mere guess.</i>)</p>

<p><i>I have studied your exposition of capitals, <span class="antiqua">I
continued</span>, with great interest and, I hope, profit,
though there is a fundamental difficulty which I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
hasten to put before you.... So long as
proper names intrude their capitals into mid-sentence
you cannot arrive at flat uniformity, and
a few capitals more or less do not offend
me....</i></p>

<p><i>I did not intend to be unfair about High Mass
and first thought of suggesting for your consideration
either Holy Communion or that hideous,
hypocritical, pusillanimous compromise beloved
of Anglicans, the “eucharist,” then substituted the
name of a ceremonial in your own church. You,
I see, write of the Real Presence without capitals.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Gross knavery and insincerity on my part;
rank scoundrelism. I’d have put caps, on any
other occasion.</i>)</p>

<p><i>I should give capitals to this and to such words
as Incarnation, Crucifixion and Ascension, when
used in a religious connection. Also to the word
Hegira and any similar words culled from any
other religion. As I told you before, I am without
a rule and would let almost any word have
its capital, if I could please it thereby. Words
used in a special sense also have their capitals
from me, as for example Hall, when that means
a college dinner served in hall. No, I am afraid
that a capital for colonel, major and vicar leaves
my teeth unmoved, and I could write postmistress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
with a capital light-heartedly. On the other
hand I should not use a capital for dustman, as
this is not a title or office.</i></p>

<p><i>I am, as you see, quite illogical and inconsistent;
and, if I try to follow your rules, it will
be only in the hope of pleasing you. I cannot
rouse myself to any enthusiasm for or against a
liberal use of capitals and I do not think that
it is a matter of great importance. On considerations
of comeliness, I think the French printed
page, with its vile type and vile, fluffy paper, is
one of the ugliest things (Nonsense, nonsense,
you unæsthetic Celt! The unsought, natural
beauty and perfection of the page make up for
all the inferiority of the material. Never say
that again! Your friend Seymour Leslie would
scratch and claw you for it.) ever allowed to
issue from a printing press, but that may be only
insular prejudice....</i></p>

thoroughly boring mood. (Grawnted.)...</i></p>

it will serve to keep the child quiet when she next

blighters....</i></p>

</div>

<p>In acknowledging the book, I objected to
what I considered the excessive importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
that is still attached to the men of the nineties
and to their work:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I doubt, <span class="antiqua">I wrote, 12.7.20</span>, whether the
years 1890 to 1900 have produced more permanent
literature of the first order than any other
decade of the 19th century—or the twentieth.
Paris was discovered anew in those days and
seemed a tremendous discovery, though its influence
was meretricious, and the imitations from
the French were usually of the worst French
models. The discovery of art for art’s sake was,
I always feel, the most meaningless and pretentious
of all other shams. Even Wilde never
made clear what he meant by the phrase, though
he and his school interpreted it practically by a
wholly decadent over-elaboration of decoration.
The interest of the period lies in the astounding
success achieved by this noisy and self-sufficient
coterie in imposing itself on the easily startled,
and easily shocked and still more easily impressed
middle and upper classes of London society.
But that is a thing that so many people can do
and a thing that is so seldom worth doing.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In a later letter, I added, 15.6.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I believe that the great bubble of the nineties
has been pricked for the present generation. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the work of Max, most of Beardsley and a little
of Wilde have a permanent place; and, if some
one would do for the poets and essayists of the
nineties what Eddie Marsh has done for the
Georgian poets, we might have one volume of
moderate size containing the poetry of interest
and good craftsmanship though of little power or
originality....</i></p>

<p><i>Whether <span class="antiqua">[the artistic movement of the
nineties]</span> effected any great liberation of spirit or
manner from the fetters of mid-Victorian literature
I cannot say, though I am inclined to doubt it.
That liberation was being achieved by individual
writers such as Meredith and Kipling, who never
had anything to do with the domino-room of the
Cheshire Cheese. Never, I am sure, was any
artistic group so void of humour as the men of the
nineties.</i></p>

<p><i>Having damned them, their period and
work so far, I may surprise you by conceding
that they do still arouse great interest.... I
have been thinking that it is almost your duty to
put on permanent record your own knowledge and
opinions about this school. Max Beerbohm is
unlikely to do it, and you must now be one of
the very few men living who were on terms of
intimacy with the leaders of the movement....
Men under thirty have never heard of John Gray,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Grackanthorpe or your over advertised American
friend Peters. Your annotations to Muddiman’s
book go some very little distance towards
filling this gap, but I think you should undertake
something more substantial. For heaven’s sake
do not call it <span class="antiqua">The History of the Nineties</span>, but
is there any reason why you should not—from
your memory and without consulting a single
work of reference—compile a little book of
<span class="antiqua">Notes on the ’Nineties</span>? Make it an informal
dictionary of biography, put down all the names
of the men associated with that movement at
leisure, record about each everything that has not
yet appeared in print and correct the occasionally
incorrect accounts of other writers. Such a book
would be a valuable addition to literary history,
it would be amusing and not difficult for you to
write, it could be turned to the profit of your
reputation and pocket....</i></p>

</div>

<p>For this criticism Teixeira took me to task
in his letter of 14.7.20.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>And now, Stephen, tremble. How often have
I not called you “the wise youth!” How constantly
have I not believed you to be filled with
knowledge, either acquired or instinctive and intuitive,
of most things! And now your
letter ... has disappointed me almost to tears.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p><i>Your only excuse would be that you took Oscar
Wilde and Bernard Shaw to be and practically
alone to be the men of the nineties. That is not
so. And, if you agree with me that Oscar was a
man of the eighties and that Shaw is a man of
the twentieth century, you have no excuse whatever
and 98% of the first paragraph in your
letter is dead wrong.</i></p>

<p><i>I presume that you keep copies of your letters
to me: you should; they will be useful for your
<span class="antiqua">Memoirs of a Celibate</span> (<span class="antiqua">John Murray: 1950;
105/- net</span>). Anyhow, here goes:</i></p>

<p><i>There was no question of either a literary revival
or revolution in the nineties and there was
no sham, colossal or minute.</i></p>

<p><i>The men engaged were not pretentious, not
conceited, not humbugs. They were a group of
men, mostly under 30, who just wrote and drew
and painted as well as they could, in all sincerity
and with no view of financial gain. Dowson, Johnson,
Horner, Image, etc., etc., etc., were the humblest,
most modest lot of literary men I ever met.</i></p>

<p><i>Their output was not immense: it was infinitesimal,
just because they were so careful to
produce only work that was “just so.” Think,
Stephen. What did Henry Harland, one of the
few to live to over 40, put out? <span class="antiqua">The Cardinal’s
Snuff Box</span>, <span class="antiqua">My Friend Prospers</span>, <span class="antiqua">Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Miss and Other Stories</span>: that is all! Ernest
Dowson: two slim volumes of verse, half-a-dozen
short stories, a collaborator’s share in two
novels. John Gray: one slim volume of verse.
Lionel Johnson: God knows how little. And so
on. Arthur Symns has worked on steadily, but,
though he is getting on for sixty, you cannot say
that his output is immense or contains anything
that was not worth doing.</i></p>

<p><i>Immensely advertised! Where? And by
whom?</i></p>

<p><i>Beardsley’s output was immense, for his years.
Ought not the world to be grateful for it? He
told me once that he had an itch for work; and it
looked afterwards as if he knew that he was
doomed to die at 24 or 26 and wanted to throw
off all he could before. When he worked no one
knew: no one ever saw him at work and he was
always about and always accessible.</i></p>

<p><i>He was not conceited.... Rickets and Shannon
were a little conceited: they had a way of
“coming the Pope” over the rest, as Will Rothenstein
once put it to me. (Will always took
“a proper pride” in his excellent work, but no
more). But, Lord, hadn’t they the right to be?
Was ever a book more beautifully designed than
<span class="antiqua">Silverpoints</span> (cover, page, type, typesetting by
Ricketts)? Place Ricketts’ cover of the <span class="antiqua">Pageant</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
beside any other book in your library and tell me
how it strikes you. Look at anything that
Charles Shannon condescends to exhibit in the
Academy and see how the quality of it slays
everything around it exactly as a picture by Whistler
or Rossetti would do.</i></p>

<p><i>To revert to immensity of output (I have to
keep levanting and tacking about), I call immense
the output of Belloc (the modern Sterne),
Chesterton (the modern Swift), E. V. Lucas
(the modern Addison); they themselves would be
flattered at the comparisons. These chaps,
though they can and sometimes do write as well
as the men of the nineties, spoil their average by
writing immensely; and they write immensely because
they want a good deal of money. Now the
men of the nineties hadn’t clubs, homes, wives or
children; lunched for a shilling; dined for eighteen
pence; and didn’t want a lot of money.
They cared neither for money nor fame; they
cared for their own esteem and that of what you
call their coterie and I their set.</i></p>

<p><i>And that (to answer a question which you once
asked me) is art for art’s sake; and I maintain
that it is not right to call this meaningless or pretentious
or a sham.</i></p>

<p><i>This coterie, or set, was not noisy: I never
met a quieter; it was self-sufficient only in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
best sense; and it in no way imposed or impressed
itself on the middle and upper classes of London
society. How could they? I doubt if any number
of the <span class="antiqua">Savoy</span> ever sold 1,000 copies; certainly
no number ever sold 2,000. And they ... were
never in society, were never in the outskirts of
society and never wanted to be in either.</i></p>

<p><i>But there! I daresay you were thinking of
Oscar all the time....</i></p>

<p><i>I can never have news, as you may imagine,
<span class="antiqua">writes Teixeira, 29.7.20</span>; my letters must be

<p><i>I like your Cave-Brown-Cave story if it was
true; it probably was, as a family of that name
exists.</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><i>I never heard John Redmond, I am sorry to
say. He was, so to speak, after my time. I
heard Parnell and, if I were only a mimic, could
give you his curiously contemptuous, high-bred,
high-pitched voice to-day. I heard Randolph;
and at the time, in the eighties, both he and
Arthur Balfour used to lisp. Does A. B. lisp
now? Answer this: it interests me; and it has
a sort of bearing on that passing-fashion competition
which you were starting. So essential
to birth and breeding was the lisp in those days
that even the English-bred Comte de Paris
lisped ... in French! I was at his silver wedding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and well remember his reception of me.</i></p>

<p>“Vouth êtes le bienvenu ithi!”</p>

<p><i>Incidentally I remember that good King Edward
(“then Prince of Wales,” as the memoir-writers
say) glared at me furiously on that occasion,
because I was wearing trousers of the
identical pattern as his: an Urquhart check with
a pink line....</i></p>

</div>

<p>In the course of a dinner-party given at
this time, the conversation turned on those men
and women who had won everlasting renown
with the least effort or justification. The
United States Ambassador (Mr. Davis) proposed
Eutychus, of whom little is known but
that he fell asleep during a sermon and
tumbled from a window: I suggested the
uncaring Gallio, who did less and is better
known. Some one else put forward Melchisedec.
Agreeing that every name in the Bible
has a certain immortality, we turned to secular
history. At the subsequent instigation
of Mr. Davis, Lord Curzon of Kedleston
propounded “the apple-bearing son of William
Tell.” I invited Teixeira to give his
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I can’t compete with Curzon, <span class="antiqua">he replied on
6.8.20</span>, though I’ve tried. After all, he was
one of the Souls! I did think of Alfred and the
cakes; but that monarch owes only 5/6 of his
immortality to those cakes and young Tell owed
all his to the apple. But stay! Many hold
Tell and his offspring to be mythical persons.
If so, what about the good wife who scolded Alfred?
I should like you to find some one who
will say that I have beaten Curzon....</i></p>

<p><i>I shall be in town from 8 September to a few
days later. If you want to see me, you must
arrange your engagements accordingly. I am the
colour which we can never get our brown shoes to
assume till just before the moment when they
drop off our feet. But I am as weak as ten thousand
rats....</i></p>

</div>

<p>On 7.8.20 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You will remember that ... I declined to join
your Passing Fashion Research Society, or whatever
you decided to call it. But I have no objection
to being an honorary corresponding member.
And I will set you a subject.</i></p>

<p><i>To establish the year in which it first became
the vogue for smart British males to don a deliberately
dowdy attire.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p><i>The dowdiness all burst upon my astonished
eyes at once: the up-and-down collar worn with
a top hat and a morning coat; permanently
turned trousers worn with Oxford shoes, so as to
display an inch or so of sock; tie usually to
match the socks and often “self-coloured” and patternless.
There are three items of sheer deliberate
dowdiness for you. Another dowdy item
was even a little earlier, I believe: the one-buttoned
glove, showing a bit of bare wrist between
it and the shirt-cuff. But the soft-fronted dress-shirt,
also a piece of dowdy dandyism, came in
much at the same time as the three specimens
cited above.</i></p>

<p><i>I should guess the year to be either 1907 or
1908, but I am not quite sure. You, with your
wonderful memory, may be able to place it, for
1907-8 marks the period when you burst upon
the London firmament.</i></p>

<p><i>I—who can remember witnessing a departure
for Cremorne—I, I need hardly tell you, remember
much older and almost as strange things.
I remember peg-top trowsers, skin-tight trowsers,
bell-shaped trowsers, though I can’t fix the epoch
of any of these phenomena; and I can remember
when we deliberately wore our trowsers so long
that we trod upon them with our heels and
frayed them; and that was in 1880-1.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p><i>But all I ask that you should fix is the date of
the deliberately dowdy well-dressed man....</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I think, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 9.8.20</span>, that the time has
come for you to write ... a big political novel,
a big, serious, flippant, earnest, sarcastic, political
novel.... Your book should be quite Disraelian
in scope; it should be a <span class="antiqua">roman a clef</span> to this
extent, that it would contain half—or quarter-portraits;
and you ought to concentrate on it
very thoroughly. I am convinced that the world
is waiting for it.</i></p>

<p><i>Do you observe the comparative sweetness of
my mood. It is doomed entirely to this glorious

like an elderly Mr. Punch on his
hustings.</i></p>

<p><i>My good, kind Brighton doctor—good because
he is clever, kind because he charges me no fee—was
over here from Brighton y’day to see me.
He tells me that this peculiar susceptibility of
mine to atmospheric influence is a symptom of
convalescence rather than ill-health. He is much
pleased with the improvement in my condition;
and he approves of my winter plans, though he
would rather have dispatched me to San Remo
or even Egypt had either been feasible.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p><i>Read Max on Swinburne in the <span class="antiqua">Fortnightly
Review</span> when you get the chance and contrast it
with George Moore’s account of his visit to Swinburne,
in which he can only tell us that he found
the poet naked in bed. I forget where it occurs....</i></p>

</div>

<p>In answering this letter I pointed out that
Disraeli avoided the great political issues of
the days in which he was writing and that any
author, such as H. G. Wells in <i>The New
Machiavelli</i>, Granville Barker in <i>Waste</i> and
H. M. Harwood in the <i>Grain of Mustard
Seed</i>, who attempts a political theme is almost
bound to impale himself on one or other
horn of a dilemma; if his novel or play revolve
round a living controversy such as the right
to strike in war-time or the justice of ordering
reprisals in Ireland, the theatre may become
the scene of a nightly riot and the critics
will consider their own political preferences
more earnestly than the literary merits of the
book; if the action of play or novel be based
on a dead or unborn controversy, it will fail
to arouse the faintest interest. I was sure
that the other admirers of the three works<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
which I quoted were unmoved by the endowment
of motherhood, by educational reform
and by housing schemes.</p>

<p>In reply, Teixeira wrote, 11.8.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... Don’t slay the suggestions of the big
political novel off-hand or outright. I mean a
bigger thing than you do; a thing that not Wells
nor Barker nor Harwood ... could write,
whereas you, I think, could; a thing as big as
<span class="antiqua">Coningsby</span>; a thing called <span class="antiqua">The Secretary of State</span>
or <span class="antiqua">The First Lord of the Treasury</span>, or some such
frank affair as that.</i></p>

<p><i>You have kept up a “very average” logical
position in life. You know a number of statesmen,
but you know only those whom you like and
you like only those whom you esteem. Your portraits
of those whom you esteem could not offend
them; your sketch even of a genial rogue ...
could not offend him; and you don’t or ought not
to care if your daguerreotypes of S., M. and B.
offended them or not....</i></p>

<p><i>Incidentally you might do no little good, to
Ireland, which should have been your native land,
to England, which by your own choice remains
your home, and to the world in general, to which
I hope that you bear no ill-will....</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>In his next letter, 14.8.20, he returns to
the same subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Your letter ... pretty well convinces me, at
any rate about the Coningsby novel. Dizzy never
wrote about the period in which he was just then
living. All his novels are antedated a good many
years. This by way of defending him against
any idea that he ever offended by betraying private
or official secrets in his novels....</i></p>

</div>

<p>One of Teixeira’s last letters (19.8.20)
from Crowborough contained a translation
of the terms (already quoted) in which
Couperus congratulated him on his version of
<i>The Tour</i>:</p>

<p>Couperus writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>“Your last envoi has given me a most delightful
day. What a magnificent translation. <span class="antiqua">The
Tour</span> is; what a most charming little book it has
become! I am in raptures over it and read and
reread it all day and have had tears in my eyes
and have laughed over it. You may think it
silly of me to say all this; but it has become an
exquisitely beautiful work in its English form.
My warmest congratulations!...</i></p>

<p><i>“Thank McKenna for his assistance: the hymn
has become very fine. For that matter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
whole book is a gem, if I may say so myself.”</i></p>

<p><i>So I’ve had one appreciative reader at any
rate!...</i></p>

</div>

<p>On 27.8.20 he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Tell Norman <span class="antiqua">[Major Holden, then liberal
candidate for the Isle of Wight]</span> that, should
there be an election in “the island” before I leave
Ventnor, he’ll find me both able and ready to
impersonate the oldest inhabitant and gallop to
the polling-station, in my bath-chair, and vote for
him....</i></p>

</div>

<p>And, finally, in praise of toleration:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>31 August 1920 (being the birthday of Her
Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands).</i></p>

<p><i>It won’t do to insist on this racial aspect of
things. I was never of those who called L. G.
a damned little Welsh solicitor. He would have
been just the same had he been Scotch or English
or Irish. After all, our friend R. is little and
Welsh and was a solicitor and will as likely as
not be damned if he doesn’t join his wife’s church.
And there is the converse case, when you hear
men describing an outrage committed by Englishmen
as “unenglish.” How can the things be unenglish
which the English do?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p><i>Like yourself, the late W. H. Smith was
shocked when Parnell stood up and told the House
of Commons ... that he had lied to them in
the interests of his country. I like to think of
you as occupying a subtler and more philosophical
standpoint than the late W. H. Smith....</i></p>

<p><i>I continue to feel better; and the arrival of
two very pretty women patients has loosed my
tongue and given me an outlet for many a childish
and innocent jest. I excuse these jests by
saying that they’re due to Minerva.</i></p>

<p><i>“Who’s Minerva?”</i></p>

<p><i>“Mi-nervous breakdown. By the way, I hope
you like your Alf?”</i></p>

<p>For the next few days Teixeira was absorbed
in his preparations for leaving Crowborough.
On arriving in London, he came
to stay with me until he and his wife went to
the Isle of Wight for the autumn and winter.</p>

<p>In acknowledging, on 1.9.20 his instructions
about the diet on which he now lived, I
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Many thanks for your letter written on the
anniversary of Her Majesty the Queen of the
Netherlands. Do not forget to date any letters
you may write on Friday the anniversary of
Naseby, the crowning mercy of Worcester and the
death of O. Cromwell.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Teixeira interpolated here:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>And the birthday of my late aunt Judith Teixeira.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>On 2.9.20 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Dodd <span class="antiqua">[Dodd, Mead and Co. Inc.]</span> is going to
reissue <span class="antiqua">[Couperus’]</span> <span class="antiqua">Majesty</span> in America and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
would like you to write a preface to it.... Will
you do this? I should very much like you to. It
involves re-reading the book, I fear; but after
that you will not have much to do except to draw
an analogy between the hero and the poor Czar,
on whose character the recent articles in the
<span class="antiqua">Times</span> have thrown an interesting light.</i></p>

</div>

<p>I reminded Teixeira that I had never read
<i>Majesty</i>, as I had never been able to secure
a copy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You’re perfectly right, <span class="antiqua">he replied on 5.9.20</span>.
I’ll bring the only copy in the world, that I know
of, in my suit-case.</i></p>

<p><i>You will be able to point to some remarkable
prophecies on C’s part (he foretold the Hague
Conference years before it happened) and, for
the rest, to let yourself go as you please on high
continental dynastic politics. I doubt if any
writer ever entered into the soul of princes as this
astonishing youth of 25 or so did....</i></p>

<p><i>I propose to revise <span class="antiqua">Majesty</span> so thoroughly that
I shall be entitled to eliminate Ernest Dowson’s
name from the title-page, even as I eliminated
John Gray’s from that of <span class="antiqua">Ecstacy</span>. There was
no true collaboration in either case; and they did
little more for me than you did in <span class="antiqua">Old People</span>:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
not so much as you did in <span class="antiqua">The Tour</span>. Neither
had the original before him.</i></p>

<p><i>I look forward greatly to my stay with you....
Eimar O’Duffy <span class="antiqua">[the author of The Wasted Island]</span>
has been married by another novelist and
has gone to live with her in a cottage in Wexford.
She spells her name Cathleen; and he has sent
me his early poems, in which he spelt his name
Eimhar. He tells me that this spelling was
abandoned because it didn’t look well; this I accept.
He adds that it is pronounced Avar: this
I do not believe....</i></p>

</div>

<p>On leaving me, Teixeira wrote 24.9.20 to
tell me that he had reached Ventnor without
mishap:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>This is not to acknowledge the receipt of any
letter from you that may or may not be awaiting
me at the County &amp; Castle Club, an edifice into
which I have not yet made my comital and castellated
entry. Rather is it to announce my safe
arrival, after four hours of wearying travel, and
my complete revival, after ten hours of refreshing
sleep, and to repeat my thanks for your utterly
exceptional and debonnair hospitality.</i></p>

<p><i>The first impression of Ventnor is favourable....</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>This pococurantist attitude, if I may employ
a phrase beloved by Teixeira, was not supported
by his wife in the postscript which
she added:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Poor fellow, he was so tired travelling and so
good over it. This place one could wear rags in,
it’s so antiquated; and we shall return confirmed
frumps and bores. There is some miniature
beauty in a low hill and a tinkly pier that would
be blown away in a quarter of a gale....</i></p>

<p><i>I have seen the sun and feel reasonably well
and happy, <span class="antiqua">Teixeira proclaims in a second letter
on the same day</span>....</i></p>

</div>

<p>From the end of September to the end of
December, when I left England, our letters—though
we corresponded almost daily were
much taken up with business matters. I
therefore only reproduce such extracts as
throw light on Teixeira’s literary opinions
and on his life at Ventnor.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My dear Stephen, loyal and true, <span class="antiqua">he writes on
3.10.20</span>; A thousand thanks for Lady Lilith,
with its charming dedication, and for your letter....
I cannot well lend you the Repington
volumes. I have them from the Times Book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Club, which is all that my poor wife has to supply
her with books. But seriously I advise you to
buy them. They are as admirable as they are
beastly. They form a perfect record of the war
as you and I saw it; you will refer to them often
in years to come; they mention every one that I
know (except yourself) and a host more, every
one that you know and a few more; and there is
a very full index to them....</i></p>

<p><i>No, do not send me the Tree book: it will
arrive in the next parcel from the Times Book
Club....</i></p>

</div>

<p>There follows an account of a characteristic
dialogue between Teixeira and his
dentist:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>New (enumerating every action, like a comic-conjurer):
“Spray!”</i></p>

<p><i>Tex: “Oremus!”...</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I wish, <span class="antiqua">he writes on 6.10.20</span>, that I had no
correspondent but you: what good stuff I could
write to you! But 19 letters in one day: think
of it!...</i></p>

<p><i>My age is a melancholy one. The man of 50
or 60 sees all his acquaintances and friends dying
off in ones and twos: Heinemann and Williamson
to-day; who will it be to-morrow? When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
he’s 70, he begins to be a sole survivor, with no
friends left to lose.</i></p>

<p><i>You will find the Tree book amusing as you go
on with it. Four-fifths of it represent the life of
a dead fairy told by living fairies, one wittier and
more whimsical than the others. I confess to
tittering over Viola’s “screwing their screws to
the sticking-point” and “peacocks held in the
leash.” And that’s a glorious portrait of Julius,
though, when I knew him, he was more mature
and more majestic....</i></p>

</div>

<p>On 11.10.20 he breaks into verse:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>As I stepped to my table from my bed.</i></div>
  </div>

</div>

<p><i>It’s that physical pain I’m after for the present.
The book hurts my eyes....</i></p>

<p><i>I’ve had a little petty cash from the Couperus
books. It’s been amusing to see that <span class="antiqua">Small Souls</span>
in a given six months produces 15 times as much
in America as in this benighted country....</i></p>

</div>

<p>Though he commonly kept his religion and
politics to himself, Teixeira’s sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the Irish moved him to write, 27.10.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I’m angrily unhappy at the death of McSwiney.
To kill a man with a face like that! Compare
the faces of those who killed him!...</i></p>

<p><i>It’s a brute of a world that the sun is shining
on so brightly....</i></p>

</div>

<p>I had contemplated spending the winter in
a voyage up the Amazon, but abandoned it
in favour of one down the east coast of South
America. Teixeira comments, 29.10.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Your new voyage is the more sensible and interesting
by far. What’s Amazon to you or you
to Amazon? I pictured you and trembled for
you, steaming slowly up that mighty river between
alligators taking pot-shots at you with poisoned
pea-shooters from one bank and hummingbirds
yapping split infinitives at you from the
other. You will be much better off on board your
goodish coasting tramp....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... It interested me, <span class="antiqua">he adds, 30.10.20</span>,
to read in this morning’s <span class="antiqua">Times</span> that Brazilian
stock has risen a couple of points at the news of
your contemplated visit. I hope that Argentine
rails will follow suit....</i></p>

<p><i><span class="antiqua">[A lady]</span> when returning Shane Leslie’s book,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>

the asinine effrontery to write to me ... of
“McSwiney’s farcical death.” Isn’t it dreadful to
think that the world has given birth to women
who can write like that?</i></p>

<p><i>Can death ever be farcical? We know that
the epithet is wholly inapposite in the present instance.
But can death ever be farcical? I told
you, I think, of Major Johnson, who, throwing
hot coppers from the balcony of the Grand Hôtel
in Paris at the crowd cheering Kruger, overbalanced
himself, fell to the pavement and was killed.
That is the nearest approach to a farcical death
that I can think of. But I should call it ironical.
A farcical death. Alas!...</i></p>

</div>

<p>On 31.10.20 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I fear you will have a hell of a windy time at
Deal or Dover or wherever Walmer Castle has
its being (Walmer perhaps, as an afterthought)?

to say “to lie like a guide-book.” One lies before
me at this moment:</i></p>

<p><i>“In fact, Ventnor is a sun-box; and the east
and north winds would have to confess that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>

<p><i>At the same moment, these self-same winds are

<p>I had been recommended to go from Buenos
Aires across the Andes to Valparaiso and to
come home by Chile, Peru and the Panama
Canal rather than to sail twice over the same
course between Buenos Aires and Southampton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>Teixeira comments on this change of plans
in his letter of 16.11.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>They have had a cyclone, I see, at “Baires,” as
the wireless used to have it at the W.T.I.D;
but, as we had a gale y’day at Ventnor, there’s
not much in that. On the other hand, how do
you propose to travel from Baires to Paradise
Valley? I ask in all ignorance: is there a railway?
I know there are Argentine Rails; but are
the Andes tunnelled? If not, what about it?
You can travel from London to Ventnor <span class="antiqua">via</span>
Cowes but also <span class="antiqua">via</span> Ryde; in my days, the route
from Baires to Valparaiso knew but one method:
to Ride, if you like, but to Ride <span class="antiqua">via</span> Llamas. Let
me warn you, a llama would spit in your eye as
soon as look at you. And you not knowing a
word of the language! How’s it to be done,
Stephen, how’s it to be done? There are bits of
the Andes where you cross a crevasse, llama and
all, in a basket slung on a rope which stretches
from precipice to precipice. Of all the cinematographic
stunts! Well, there! Have you a nice
revolver?...</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... Tell me what you think that you are going
to eat between Baires and Valparaiso, <span class="antiqua">he adds
next day</span>. They grow comparatively few fish on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the slopes or even on the crests of the Andes....</i></p>

<p><i>As a matter of curiosity, write to me to-morrow
what your weather was like now at 9.15 a.m. to-day.
I am sitting at a wide-open window actually
perspiring (saving your presence) with heat.</i></p>

</div>

<p>I reassured him as best I could (17.11.20):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... Those who know tell me that there is a
perfectly good railway from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso
with a permanent way, rolling stock,
points and signals, tunnels to taste and all the
paraphernalia that one might buy on a small scale
at Hamley’s toy-shop. The Andes ought, of
course, to be crossed on mule-back, but this takes
long and I do not know any mules. Nor, from
your exposition of their habits, am I desirous of
meeting any llamas....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My faithful Stephen, many thanks for your
three letters, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 21.11.20</span>. I’ve been
feeling rather out of sorts these last few days
and have not written to you since Thursday, I
believe; not that I have much to tell you ...
except that, were I weller and stronger, I should
write and offer my sword to that maligned monarch,
Constantine I. of the Hellenes. I am
growing heartily sick of seeing countries meddling
in other countries’ business....</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>It were the baldest side on my part, <span class="antiqua">he confesses
on 23.11.20</span> to pretend that the weather here
has not turned cold. The winds are what is
known as bitter. But the sun is shining like
blazes. And there you have what I was leading
up to: once bitter, twice shining.</i></p>

<p class="right"><i><span style="margin-right: 4.5em;">Ever yours,</span><br>
Alexander Crawshay.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Not content with emulating Mrs. Robert
Crawshay’s wit and appropriating her name,
Teixeira laid his witticism before her and
challenged her to say that it was not of the
true brand. There is a reference to this in a
later letter; his next communication was a
picture-postcard of Ventnor, annotated by
himself:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>A. <span class="antiqua">[A bathchair man]</span> This is not me.</i></p>

<p><i>B. <span class="antiqua">[A child with a hoop]</span> Nor is this, really.</i></p>

<p><i>C. <span class="antiqua">[An indistinguishable figure]</span> This might
be.</i></p>

<p><i>D. <span class="antiqua">[A picture of the hotel]</span> But probably
I am here, lurking in the Royal Hotel, where I
can sea the sea but the sea can’t see me.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I think little of your latest joke, <span class="antiqua">I wrote, 24.11.20</span>,
and have myself made several of late
that put yours into the shade. Thus, on learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
that a woman of my acquaintance had left her
rich husband and run away with a penniless lover,
I added the conclusion that they were now living
in silver-gilty splendour. I can assure you that
that is far more in the true Crawshay tradition....</i></p>

</div>

<p>My effort met with less than no approval:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My poor Stephen!, <span class="antiqua">Teixeira wrote 25.11.20</span>.
The worst of your jokes, when you attempt to
play upon words, is that they have all been made
before. It must be 36 (thirty-six) years (I said,
years) since I saw at the old Strand Theatre a
play called <span class="antiqua">Silver Guilt</span> parodying <span class="antiqua">The Silver
King</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>I am glad or sorry, whichever I should be, that
your arm<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has taken (<span class="antiqua">arma virumque cano</span>: beat
that if you can! <span class="antiqua">Virus</span> poison, acc. (I hope
and trust) <span class="antiqua">virum</span>)....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My conscience smites me, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 26.11.20</span>,
for having omitted in either of my last two
letters to express the sympathy which I feel with
Seymour Leslie—and you—in this serious illness
of his. What is it exactly? Whatever it may
be, I hope that he will get the better of it....</i></p>

<p><i>His aunt Crawshay has been good enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
pass “once bitter, twice shining.” She says that
it “is a really worthy phrase and will be of use to
us all!”...</i></p>

<p><i>I have been reading a lot of French lately, in
those very cheap, double-columned, illustrated
editions. It is perfectly marvellous to see how
happily the French draughtsmen succeed in catching
their authors’ ideas, whereas one may safely
say that “our” British illustrators do not catch
them once in ten times. Why is this? I am not
sure that a certain rough, unwashed Bohemianism
is not at the bottom of it, achieving results
which are beyond that prim, priggish mode of
life which nowadays governs the artists on this
side. I may be wrong: I certainly couldn’t
elaborate my theory; on the other hand, I may be
perfectly right....</i></p>

</div>

<p>In an earlier letter I had asked why he
sought a refuge where he could see the sea but
where the sea could not see him. The answer
is given in a postscript:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I might turn giddy if the <span class="antiqua">sea saw</span> me; but it
would look very ugly if <span class="antiqua">I saw</span> it.</i></p>

</div>

<p>By way of revenge I reminded Teixeira
that the gender of <i>virus</i> was neuter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Alas!, <span class="antiqua">he replies, 27.11.20</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>I suspected it at the time; and now my uprooted
hairs are beglooming the pink geraniums
below my window. I have taken my oath; and
now you and I are pledged: no French, you; no
Greek or Latin, I. It may be all for the best.</i></p>

<p><i>And <span class="antiqua">arma virusqus cano</span> would have sounded
so much better!...</i></p>

</div>

<p>Returning to the subject of French Illustration,
he adds, 28.11.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>It’s the knock-about, rough-and-tumble, café life
in Paris I expect, that accounts for the greater
success of the French illustrators. They all of
them meet all the authors in the great <span class="antiqua">Bourse à
poignées de main</span> that are the Paris coffee-houses.
The subjects are discussed over a thousand
books; and the draughtsman is not overpaid....
What I’m “after” is this, that the British illustrators,
sitting at home in their neatly-swept fiats
or studios, decorated mainly with Japanese fans,
furnished with wives instead of mistresses, that
these smug dogs, with their pappy brains, <span class="antiqua">cannot</span>
turn out such good work or enter so well into the
spirit of things, as the Frenchman. And, if all
this sounds damned immoral, I can’t help it.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The shadow of Christmas fell across Teixeira’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
mind so early as the first day of December:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I ask myself, <span class="antiqua">he writes</span>:</i></p>

<p><i>“What shall I give this Stephen? A
book?... But he’s got a book!... Ah,
but has he a three-volume novel? No, bedad!...
And, as I live, I don’t believe that <span class="antiqua">Violet
Moses</span> is included in his collected edition of the
works of that mighty writer, Leonard Merrick.”</i></p>

<p><i>So here’s a first edition for you, with my blessing.
<span class="antiqua">[Your secretary]</span> should try to remove the
labels with that nastiest of utensils, a wet, hot
sponge....</i></p>

</div>

<p>For the first time in many months Teixeira
was driven back on <i>The Wrong Box</i> to find
an adequate comparison with the informative
newcomer who now disturbed the noiseless
tenour of his way:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Joseph Finsbury has arrived, <span class="antiqua">he writes,
2.12.20</span>. Overhearing me tell my wife that
Bucharest is the capital of Roumania, he leant
forward and asked me if I had been to Bucharest.</i></p>

<p><i>Tex: No.</i></p>

<p><i>Joseph: Oh, I thought I heard you mention
Bucharest.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p><i>Tex: I sometimes mention places which I have
never visited.</i></p>

<p><i>Joseph: Bucharest is a second Paris.</i></p>

<p><i>Tex: Grrrrrrrrmph!</i></p>

<p><i>Joseph: Though I daresay it has been destroyed
by now.</i></p>

<p><i>Tex: (to his wife).... Have you done with <span class="antiqua">Femina</span>?
If so, I’ll give it to those Dutch ladies.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Stalks off to Mrs. and Miss van L.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Joseph: (to an Irish widow) I have been to
all the capitals of Europe ... (and holds the
wretched Mrs. N. enthralled, so I am told, for
two mortal hours)....</i></p>

<p><i>Later. Joseph (to <span class="antiqua">[my wife]</span>): How clever
of your husband to speak Dutch to those ladies!</i></p>

<p><i><span class="antiqua">[My wife]</span>: Not at all! He’s a Dutchman.</i></p>

<p><i>Joseph: I know Holland very well. I have been
to Rotterdam. I have been to Java. The finest
botanical gardens in the world are at Buitenzorg
near Batavia.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="antiqua">[My wife]</span>: Re-e-ally!</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Can you <span class="antiqua">Teixeira asks, 2.12.20</span>, lend me that
book by James Joyce (<span class="antiqua">Portrait of the Artist</span>),
which you once wrote to me about? I see Barbellion
praises it enthusiastically in the new diary.</i></p>

<p><i>Would you like me to lend you <span class="antiqua">A Last Diary</span>
or have you bought it?</i></p>

<p><i>Your Uncle Joseph was in disgrace yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
We have a girl trio of musicians here, who play
at tea-time and eke after dinner. The pianist
reports that he said to her:</i></p>

<p><i>“I have been to Japan. I was very ill there
and I found myself in the arms of a Japanese
woman.”</i></p>

<p><i>To-day he stopped me in the road and said:</i></p>

<p><i>“I wish I could speak Dutch, sir, as well as you
speak English. I once learnt a continental language,
but I mustn’t speak it now. What it was”
(throwing out his arms) “you can guess....”</i></p>

</div>

<p>I had read Barbellion’s two books without
sharing Teixeira’s admiration for them, in
part because I thought that a book of self-revelation
so unreserved should only have
been published posthumously, in part because
it was incongruous—to use no stronger word—to
find a man, who had aroused wide-spread
compassion by what was taken to be the account
of his last hours, reading with relish
the sympathetic press notices which it brought
him.</p>

<p>To this criticism Teixeira replies, 5.12.20:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Thank you for your two letters and the loan
of James Joyce.... Barbellion I like and almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
love—I should love him entirely but for a
common strain in him that makes itself heard
occasionally—but then I was taught very early
in life to make every allowance for men of any
genius, whereas you look for the public-school
attitude towards all and sundry. Apart from
this, B. seems to me to have borne almost unparalleled
suffering with remarkable courage and to
have shown a good deal of pluck besides in laying
bare his soul in the midst of it all.</i></p>

<p><i>You see, if one cared to take the pains, one
could make you detest pretty well everybody you
know and like. For everybody has a mean,
petty, shabby, cowardly side to him; and one has
only to tell you of what the man in question
chooses to keep concealed. B. chose to reveal
it; that’s all about it....</i></p>

<p><i>My wife bids you be sure to say good-bye,
when you go on your travels, to the woman,
whoever she may be, in whom you are most interested.
Her reason is that she dreamt two
nights ago that you were prevented from doing
so. This does not imply that you will not return
alive. It means only that something prevented
you from saying good-bye to that person and that
it would be fun to stultify the dream....</i></p>

</div>

<p>On 7.12.20 Teixeira writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... I am reading James Joyce, skippily. The
fellow has a great deal of talent, but much of it is
misdirected. I should not be surprised if one day
he began to write books that he and his country
will be proud of....</i></p>

<p><i>Incidentally I admire his ruthless suppression
of capitals and am interested in his ditto ditto
of hyphens....</i></p>

</div>

<p>On Christmas Eve, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Forgive us our Christmases as we forgive them
that Christmas against us.</i></p>

<p><i>What I want to know by your next letter and

<p>The diary which Teixeira kept for me
during my absence in South America was,
so far as I am aware, his first venture in
this kind of literature. Approaching it with
trepidation, he abandoned it with loathing.
The mystery of a double cash-column quickly
palled; and he was not long intrigued even
by printed reminders of the moon’s phases and
of the days on which dividends and insurance-policy
renewals became due.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">30 December 1920.</p>

<p>As a large number of these Diaries circulate
abroad it may be well to point out that the Astronomical
Data, such as phases of the moon etc.
are given in Greenwich time.</p>

sent to their bedrooms. Some would suggest the
coal-hole; but I, as you know, have a gentle
heart.... Remember that we live in an age

yelling is not confined to children. Adults enjoy
equal rights. Next time a child raises its voice

<p>On 27.3.21 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Dodd arrived on Thursday: I say, he arrived.
He arrived by travelling from London to Southhampton
in a luggage-van with a first-class ticket
(what’s the penalty for that?); by running his
boat into the mud 10 minutes from Cowes; by
missing his connection; by changing at Ryde; and
by repeating his offence “thence” and “hither”:
<span class="antiqua">i.e.</span> travelling with the same ticket in a second
luggage-van. At 9 p.m. he arrived, greeting me
with the words:</i></p>

<p><i>“I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast.”</i></p>

<p><i>You should have seen the poor fellow torn
between two longings, with a plateful of soup
before him while waiting for a Ventnor cocktail,
consisting of 98% Plymouth gin and 2% orange
bitters.</i></p>

<p><i>We motored him on Friday to Blackgang, to
Chale, to Carisbrooke, to Newport, to Brading,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
to Bembridge, to Sandown, to Shanklin and back.
Having already familiarized himself with Cowes
and Ryde, he declared that he had now seen
every city in the Isle of Wight except Freshwater.</i></p>

<p><i>I lay low about Yarmouth, but yesterday I
walked him back from Bonchurch, after my
doctor had motored us “thither.”</i></p>

<p><i>We did a lot of talking in between, but he did
not sap my vitality.... He left after tea for
France, <span class="antiqua">via</span> Southhampton and Havre; and I
was able to sit up, take nourishment and even
stand and watch a ball-room full of people dance
Lent out on what the festive programme called
“Easter Saturday”: Christians, you may or
may not be aware, call it Holy Saturday....</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... I booked a seat on a four-in-hand this
morning to go to certain point-to-point races;
cancelled it; received an invitation from my young
doctor to take me there in his car; declined it,
feeling too weak and sulphurous.... I have
a leg, like Sir Willoughby what’s-his-name; but
this leg is covered with patterns (Sir Willoughby
Patterne, was it?) and to cure it I am covered
and lined with brimstone. It is not curing; and
I am just tempersome, that’s all....</i></p>

of their money: oh, how like nothing on earth I
feel after being brought to bed of this joke!
I am to have a cake with 56 candles in it from my
doctor’s wife, which her name is Phyllis Twigg;
so let no one send me an other. If I ate more

present had to be delayed while Teixeira
described his effort to observe an eclipse:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I ordered a pail and some water (“and let the
water be inside the pail”) to be placed on the lawn
this morning, so that I might observe the eclipse
of the sun. The eclipse was over before I got
down; as the pail was bright white that made no
difference. Things looked very uncanny from
my bedroom window and I tried to tremble like a
Red Indian: they tremble, as you know, like Red
Indianything....</i></p>

</div>

<p>It was written on the morrow of his birthday,
10.4.21:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Many thanks for your letter of the 8th, for
your good wishes and for a noble <span class="antiqua">Catholic Dictionary</span>,
with which I was mightily pleased. It
will be of great value to me if I live (a) to edit
<span class="antiqua">The Autumn of the Middle Ages</span>, by Huisinga
and (b) to translate The Land of Rembrand, by
Busken Huet, two monumental tasks which I have
been discussing with Dodd....</i></p>

<p><i>You have presumably bought <span class="antiqua">Queen Victoria</span>,

dull book. And I read that, on Friday last,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
eight gentleman were seen sitting in a row in
Kensington Gardens, all reading Strachey’s book.
If, however K. G. were closed to the public on
Friday, then the story is mythical....</i></p>

<p><i>Your birthday-stunt worked wonders. Miracles
never cease: R—— sent me an Omar Khayyam!
R. a round or circular photograph-frame of
a precious metal known as silver. N. F. 25 cigars
of the por Laranaga flavor. B. 50 of the
flavour known as Romeo y Julieta. P. 100 cigarettes
of the snake-charming flavour, which, being
manufactured from the finest high-grade selected
Turkish leaf tobacco, must be exchanged
for the cigarettes of Ole Virginny when I am next
in hail of one of Messrs. Salmon &amp; Gladstone’s
famous establishments.</i></p>

<p><i>This exhausts your list. Over and above these
gifts, I received from S. an Umps, <span class="antiqua">i.e.</span> a biscuit-ware
naked doll, with wings, practicable arms
and a heart in the right, non-commital place, in
the middle of its chest. Also, a neat black and
grey tie. From Mrs. H. a tie.... From my
wiff a tie and a pair of mittens, for elderly early-morning
wear. From the manageress of the hotel,
a knitted canary waistcoat with sapphire buttons
to cover the nudity of the Umps. From an
anonymous admirer, a smaller naked doll, made,
I venture to think, of celluloid-georgette. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
a lady staying at the hotel, a box of Sainsbury’s
chocolates, which are the most toothsome in the

age 75, a box of other chocolates, and 50 De

with her own money, a bottle of ink and a ball of
twine. From her mother, P. T., neé McKenna—nay,
Mackenzie—two blue-bird electric-light
shades.</i></p>

<p><i>The T’s, who belong to my local doctor, in
the proportion of one wife and one daughter, also
gave me a birthday party. To meet me were invited
Dr. C., Dr. F., and Captain Cave-Brown-Cave.
It opened with an ode or oratorio about
fairies and happiness, intoned by Anne and Dr.
C. to an accompaniment by Mrs. T. Then Anne
put her arms round my neck, embraced me tenderly
and told me not to mind what Mrs. Teixeira
said about my touting for presents: Mrs. Teixeira
didn’t mean it, couldn’t mean it; and Anne
didn’t believe it, couldn’t believe it. With the
tears streaming down the knees of my cashmere
trouserings, I was led in to tea to see my name
spelt in letter-biscuits and my birthday-cake surrounded
by 56 pink, green, white and red candles.
Then we played bridge and I won eight shillings.
And I doubt if Queen Victoria ever described a
birthday more fully.</i></p>

<p>I had the misfortune to offend Teixeira by
quoting a passage from Sir James Frazer’s
<i>Golden Bough</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I save my temper, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 22.4.21</span>, by
not discussing religion except with Catholics or
politics except with liberals. There’s room for
discussion in the <span class="antiqua">nuances</span>, there’s too much room
for it with those who call my black white. I
never dispute the goodness of certain infidels nor
the wickedness of many of the faithful. What I
hate is the smug-smiling affectation of superiority
displayed by the agnostics....</i></p>

<p><i>Huxley I have proved guilty—at least to my
own satisfaction—of intellectual dishonesty and
financial turpitude; of Frazer I know nothing
whatever. I vaguely pictured him as one of several
distinguished compilers of whom I knew
nothing; that beastly quotation at the head of one
of your chapters came as a great shock to me,
which grew into a very cataclysm when I found it
followed by another and a longer one.</i></p>

<p><i>I won’t call you an Englishman again. But it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>

going into the matter of what you think or
do not think about religion....</i></p>

county which I had never heard of (Morayshire),
a salmon—the whole bird—weighing 7½ lbs. and
measuring somewhere about 7½ feet. I distributed
3 lbs. to my doctor and 3 lbs. to the heir
presumptive to the Cave-Brown-Cave baronetcy
(with apologies for the radical source of the gift).
My wiff and I ate 3 oz. of it to our dinner; and
the remainder was consumed by the manageress,
the bookkeeper and housekeeper of the Royal

<p>In the summer and autumn of 1921 Teixeira
enjoyed better health than at any time in the
last seven years. He supported without ill-effects
the strain of incessant luncheon and
dinner-parties during the visit of Couperus
to London; he moved from house to house,
staying with friends; he completed his unfinished
work and laid ambitious schemes for
the future.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I have written to Couperus, <span class="antiqua">he told me,
13.5.21</span>, preparing him to be entertained by the
Titmarsh Club and by the Asquiths....</i></p>

<p><i>You might tell me in an early letter what to
do in proposing <span class="antiqua">[him]</span> for temporary honorary
membership of the Reform Club and when to do
it....</i></p>

<p><i>The second allocution sounds almost superfluous;
but I will not waste a sheet of Ryman’s

of “My dear Stephen” to form the “M” of
“Many thanks for your letter of the 14th.”
However, you may remember that the only difference
between Moses and Manchester is that
one ends in -oses and the other in -anchester;
and there you are....</i></p>

<p><i>I am calling on the Netherlands minister at
half-past eleven this morning.... Bisschop (of
the Anglo-Batavian Society) rang me up on Saturday
evening.... There is to be a council-meeting
at 4 o’clock on Friday at the International
Law Association in King’s Bench Walk....
If you are back by Friday and likely to be at
home, I’ll come on to see you from there. And
I’ll write to you to-morrow about my call on Van
Swinderen....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>P.S. to my former letter, <span class="antiqua">he writes on the
same day:</span> Van Swinderen was most charming.
He at once offered to have the Dutch reading at
the legation.... I said that, if Van S. would
make it an invitation matter, he would be doing
a great honour to C. and giving a very welcome
reception to the Dutch colony in London....</i></p>

<p><i>He leapt at this; said he would give a dinner
to twenty of la <span class="antiqua">crême de la crême</span>; he could manage
thirty at two tables; and ask up to a hundred
to the reception....</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

agreement; and I am to lunch there on
Friday and hear more....</i></p>

</div>

<p>When Couperus returned to Holland, my
correspondence with Teixeira was suspended.
We were meeting or communicating by telephone
almost daily; and it was only when we
left London to stay with friends that the
letters were resumed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Weather hot and stuffy, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 1.8.21,
from Sutton Courtney</span>. Lawns running down to
a perfectly full river and absolutely dry: and I
with not much to tell you....</i></p>

<p><i>I am sleeping beautifully and eating lightly;
and I feel too indolent for words.</i></p>

<p><i>Good-bye and bless you!</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>My wife, <span class="antiqua">he writes, 5.8.21</span>, pictures me surrounded
by people who, if she broke my heart
by dying, would thrust women of forty on me,
“dear, dearest Mr. Tex,” to look after me. Is
it not a beautifully witty tag to a letter? I think
so....</i></p>

</div>

<p>To my reproach that he had left London
without saying good-bye to me, he replies,
16.8.21 with complete justification:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>As our logical neighbours across the channel say:</i></p>

<p><i>“Zut!... Zut!... Et encore zut!...”</i></p>

<p><i>Had you profited as you ought by the careful
bringing up which your kind parents gave you,
you would have known that it is for those who
go away to say good-bye, for those who arrive to
say good-day. You left London before I did.
I say no more in reply to your reproaches....</i></p>

<p><i>If ever you leave London, however, at about
the same time as I, remember, will you not, the
etiquette (French) and the punctilio (Italian)?...</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... If you think that I have much to tell you,
<span class="antiqua">he adds, 20.8.21</span>, you are mistaken. Y’day I
went for a stroll, turned up a footpath which I
imagined would bring me back here, found that
it didn’t, after I had gone much too far to turn
back, and plodded on and on—my apprehensive
mind full of a picture of myself being devoured
by onsticelli and stercoraceous geodurpes amid a
fine setting of ferns and bracken—until I reached
Abingdon. It might have been Oxford, so exhausted
was I.</i></p>

y’day and brother R. M. came down before
dinner. He is a pleasant New Zealander and
took a lot out of me at bridge.</i></p>

<p><i>Life here pursues its quiet course. I accompanied
M. and W. to the sea’s edge yesterday
but found the effort of ploughing through the
shingle tolerably exhausting and shall not repeat
it to-day. Indeed, the whole family, Miss T. included,
are bathing now and I am writing twaddle
to you under the pear-tree.</i></p>

<p><i>And, as I live, I think I’ll write no more. I
have no more to say; and the papers have just

spend an hour or two in Chichester cathedral and

<p>On his return to Chelsea and a typewriter,
he says, 1.9.21:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You will be pleased to receive a letter from me
in legible type, instead of in that hand which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
becoming almost as crabbed as yours. And I
continue to address you at Bamborough Castle,
though that stronghold figures as something very
near Zambuk Castle in your letter of 30 August.</i></p>

<p><i>N. filled me with fears of internecine feuds
within your fortress, of bloody strife for the one
shady nook of the orchard and so on. You say
nothing of these things; and I assume that there
has been no slaughter in your time. There was
a horrid game when I became a British kid in the
early seventies: I am king of the castle! Get
out, you dirty rascal! I trembled at the thought
of you and N. playing this game against ruthless
border clansmen. All’s well that ends well....</i></p>

<p><i>I lost twenty goodish guineas at three-handed
bridge after Brother Roy arrived. He wanted
to can everything on the estate: the apples, the
pears, the fleas on the dogs’ backs, the flyaway
ducks. He wanted to introduce New Zealand
mutton-birds into this country....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I had a tooth out yesterday, <span class="antiqua">he writes,
3.9.21</span>,—until then I had thirteen of my own left,
an unlucky number—and was not at my best....
The tooth was extracted at a high cost, in the
presence of a dentist, an anaesthetist and my
body-physician but without unpleasant consequences.
And this afternoon I go to the Sutros
for a brief week-end.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p><i>I have no news, except that I have bought
some most attractive socks, or half-hose....</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>... I have no news, <span class="antiqua">he complains, 12.9.21.</span>
I write to you simply out of friendship and
duty. I spent five hours at the Zoo y’day....
We lunched there; so did most of the beasts,
heavily. You should have seen S. staggering
under the weight of about nine pounds of the
most expensive oranges, bananas, apples and
onions, not to mention sugar, monkey-nuts, and
two raw eggs. Say what you will, it is laffable to
feed a small monkey with slices of apple till he
has both pouches full, all four hands and his
mouth. When you hand him the eighth slice,
you wait in breathless expectation....</i></p>

<p><i>I had a tooth extracted last week, reducing
the number of my real teeth to twelve. To-day
the number of my pseudo-teeth is to be increased
to eighteen (quite correct: they swindle you out
of a couple) and I propose to lunch at the Reform
Club with many gaps in my mouth.</i></p>

<p><i>I have arranged terms for two luvverly rooms
at the Tregenna Castle Hotel, St. Ives, from
1 November to 1 April. Rooms face south, away
from the beastly ocean; breakfast in the bedroom;

happy there. I must see much of you before
you go to Sweden....</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p><i>At the Reform Club ... I played a little
bridge ... and won 29/-; then, finding my rate
of progress rather slow, I veered off to Cleveland

apple-sauce and custard and (damn the expense)
a ha’porth of cheese and so to bed.</i></p>

<p>I had been invited to deliver some lectures
in Sweden and Denmark. Teixeira was good
enough to read the manuscript of these, as of
almost everything I wrote. With his letter
of 3.10.21 he returned the first:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Here is your lecture ... I really cannot suggest
any cuts. My one and only lecture read 2¾
minutes: this is no reason why yours should not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
read an hour and a quarter. Does any one want
to go and sit in a hall, with free light and warmth
thrown in for less than an hour and a quarter?
No; the Swedes will admire your fluency and be
pleased with you.</i></p>

</div>

<p>On my return to England, he asks,
14.11.21:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>When do we meet? We have decided to leave
on the 30th. I can lunch with you to-morrow,
if you like, and bring you your two Ewald books.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Teixeira’s departure to Cornwall, already
delayed by his wife’s illness, had now to be
postponed again, as he was prostrated with
ptomaine poisoning.</p>

<p>Both invalids were sufficiently recovered
to face the journey on 2 December; and, next
day, Teixeira sent me news of his safe arrival:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Tregenna Castle Hotel,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">St. Ives, Cornwall,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">3 December, 1921.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>My dear Stephen:</i></p>

<p><i>Thanks for your letter that reached me just
before I left town. This is my address: what
else would it be? And the enclosed <span class="antiqua">[an invitation
to lecture]</span> is sent to show you that you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
not the only Beppo on the peach (damn your
British metaphors!): you might not believe it
otherwise. But you may picture the courteous
terms in which I declined.</i></p>

<p><i>There is nothing for nervous dyspepsia or gastric
horribobblums like seven goodish hours in
a swift and powerful railway-express. I have
been free from pain or sickness for the first night
since Wednesday week. But I slept little.
From 1 a.m. onwards I spent a sleepless, painless
night.</i></p>

<p><i>The hotel is comfortable and commodious in
an old-fashioned country-house way; no central
heating, but big fires; a certain amount of intrigue
with Lizzie the chambermaid to secure a really
hot bath: you know the sort of thing; immense
grounds, a very park of 100 acres, which I shall
never leave, because, if I did, I should never get
back: we stand too high.</i></p>

<p><i>Bless you.</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Ever yours,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Tex.</span></i></p>

</div>

<p>It was the last letter that I ever received
from him; and on Monday, December the
fifth, as I was in the middle of answering it,
a telegram informed me that he had died that
morning. As he was getting up, he collapsed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
in his wife’s arms and slipped, unconscious,
on the floor. Death was instantaneous and,
it may be presumed and hoped, painless.
He was buried in the Holy Roman Catholic
Cemetery at St. Ives; and a requiem mass for
the repose of his soul was said at the Brompton
Oratory.</p>

<p>Even those with best cause to suspect how
nerveless was his grasp on life could not
readily believe that one who loved life so
well was to enjoy no more of it. “He was
spared old age,” said one friend; but to
another Tex had lately confessed that he
would like to live for ever.</p>

<p>Before he left London, we said good-bye
for five months: he was to winter in Cornwall,
I in the West Indies. In seeing again the
exquisite handwriting of these many hundreds
of letters that commemorate our friendship
for the last six years of his life, I at least
cannot feel that his voice has grown silent
or that his laughter is at an end. The big,
solemn figure is vividly present; the favourite
phrases and the familiar gestures are stamped
for ever on the memory of any one that loved
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>I am writing four thousand miles away
from St. Ives: and it may be possible to fancy
that he has been ordered to remain there
longer than we expected. This time there
may be no diary; perhaps the only letters will
be those already written; he may seem not to
hear all that he once loved hearing; but,
wherever he has gone, his personality remains
behind.</p>

<p>It was an old-standing bond that the survivor
should write of the other. I have tried
to make Teixeira paint his own portrait. If
his letters have failed to reveal him, what can
I add? His literary position is unchallenged;
those who knew him how slightly soever
knew his humour and wit, his whimsical
charm, his understanding and toleration.
Those who knew him best had strongest
reason for loving him most deeply. Those
who knew him not missed knowing a ripe
scholar, a fine and tender spirit, a great and
gallant gentleman, a matchless companion
and the truest friend on earth.</p>

the celebrated life of Sir Christopher Wren by Mr. E. Clerihew

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> The reference here is to a story illustrative of the tricks
which a man’s memory sometimes plays him:</p>

<p>Reading in the <i>Morning Post</i>, that Mr. John Brown, of 500
Clarges Street, is shortly leaving for Uganda on a big-game-shooting
expedition and would like a gentleman to come with
him, sharing expenses, thought no more of the advertisement
and went about his day’s work. That night he dined intemperately.
On being ejected from his club, he was bound for home
when he recalled the forgotten advertisement and decided that
something must be done about it.</p>

<p>Driving to 500 Clarges Street, he demanded to see Mr. John
Brown.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. John Brown?” he enquired of a sleepy and
illhumoured figure in pyjamas.</p>

<p>“I am, sir,” answered John Brown.</p>

<p>“You’re the Mr. John Brown going shooting Uganda?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You want shome one come with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”...</p>

<p>“Share ’spenshes?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You put that ’vertisshment in <i>Morning Posht</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought sho. Shorry knock you up. Felt I musht tell
you.... that I’m not coming.”...</p>
